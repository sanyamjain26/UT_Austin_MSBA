Stout lovers of the world, unite and take over.', 'Had on tap at Bulldog Saloon Lynnwood, WA.', \"I'm rating this based off of the Kentucky Breakfast Stout drop, BeerAdvocate says it's retired but I just grabbed a pack of them last week. It is SARCASTICALLY chocolate, perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion, but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. I love this whenever I'm really in the mood for something rich, but any other time it's a bit much. Great specialty beer.\", \"Almost pure black with a small tan head. The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bitNot surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.\", 'Pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink, smells of coffee with a slight sweetness... black coffee with one sugar. has a medium mouth feel, tastes of bitter coffee, maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe', '12 ounce bottle, poured after warming for 30 minutes, into a Founders snifter.Dark mud coffee black, fine dense brown head that recedes slowly.Aroma of Italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe Cubano. A chocolate note too.Wickedly tasty, leads right off with the coffee. Then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. Finishes mildly sweet, then slightly bitter and dry.Oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. Medium carbonation.Overall, a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘anytime’ treat.', 'I love coffee. I love stouts. I love oatmeal stouts. I usually love coffee stouts. Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.', 'Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.']   \n",

Amazing flavors, mouthfeel and great abv. A truly enjoyable beverage', 'Type: IPATaste: Intense, balanced, and hop-forwardColor: Deep amberA standout example of the IPA style. Pours a deep amber, intense and well balanced.Strong hop, blends pine, citrus and resinous hops. Memorable impression. One of my favourites.', 'I came across this on a recent rail tour of the US. It’s available in the cafe car on most of Amtrak’s long distance services. It looks like there’s no requirement to state the abv of beers at the point of sale as I didn’t realise it was 9% til I had the first sip! Lovely stuff though sadly not available in the UK.', \"One of my favorite dipa ish IPAs. It has a wonderful full bodied dipa taste but doesn't hit you like a higher alcohol ipa. I love the higher ibu that seems to be lacking in many ipa's these days.\", 'Look: sap color orangeSmell: hoppy, malty, slightly citrusy and piney hopTaste: piney hop, rind/pithe, malt, some sweetness in there, slight bitterness that starts to build up but then just kinda doesnt (if that makes any sense)Feel: Nice full boy, low carbonation (the feel of this beer might be my favorite thing about it)Overall: Pretty crushable, fairly tame, nothing too offensive. That being said, nothing stands out, but I suppose you could also say that just means its well balanced. Not my cup for IPA\\'s, but good*poured from a can on clearance that \"expires\" in 4 months, so I def think this needs a revisit with a fresh brew.', \"Pours an opaque rusty orange, thin collar of head with good retention and no lacing. Nose is sappy hops and malt, low grade maple syrup, cooked barley and kasha, honey sticks. Taste essentially follows - malts are sweet (honey, maple, sap), while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice. Mouthfeel, despite the sweetness and heft, isn't too heavy, while the carbonation stays light. 90 Minute tastes like an ingredient to me - it has a distinct taste (sweet, spicy, sappy honey) - that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread. On its own, however, it's a little too overpowering to be enjoyable. I remember 90 minute being this huge outlier when it came out, and weirdly, it still is in terms of its flavor profile among imperial IPAs.\", 'Very smooth almost chewy. My 1st time with this world class IPA today and I am impressed. The alcohol is there and you should be prepared for it, but overall the taste smell finish and mouth feel was excellent', 'From Siciliano’s Market in Grand Rapids - had several times but now a few years - will not wait that long again.Pours a clear orange amber colour with slightly tawny coloured head that replenishes nicely with a little swirl.Nose is at once hoppy with citrus rind, tangerine, a touch of tropical fruit and floral aroma , but solidly malty with a subtle caramel note.Taste is a barrage of hops - piney, citrus, orange, pineapple and marmalade with a bitterness that is tamed by the sweet toasted malt with hints of caramel and honeysuckle.A sticky slightly resinous full mouthfeel finishes this with a coating bittersweetness.', 'Easily my favorite imperial IPA and possibly IPA period.Pours a beautiful crystal clear amber color with a tan-white head that long persists as a rim.Aroma is very strongly floral and earthy.Despite being rated as 90 IBUs this is not a bitter beer thanks to the adequate amount of malt being added to balance the hops. The flavor is citrusy and earth with a crisp finish, making this an easy drinking beer despite its high ABV.Really just the ideal poster child for the style of IPAs as a whole.', '12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip.Best by 7/2023L: Clear amber, two fingers of antique-white head, the persistent foam leaves lace.S: Kind of a malty aroma with notes of citrus and pine.T: Earthy hops with less citrus than the nose but grapefruit and pine, medium sweet malt, herbal tea note, nice malt-hop balance, moderate bitterness spikes at the finish.F: Medium body, moderate carbonation, smooth frothy feel, peppery finish.O: Very drinkable, balanced, well done classic style DIPA.']   \n",

Wife doesn’t like it so it’s my go-to beer when camping.Reasonably priced in my area.', \"12oz can with date code 062823. Served in a pint glass. Bit coppery color, orange amber, with a thick white head. Very nice start. Old school AIPA aromas of citrus and maybe some pine. Really substantial mouthfeel owing to a solid malt backbone with some crystal malts along with a creamy load of carbonation. Maybe even oats in the mash? But anyway, this is an IPA, and it brings along a very reasonable level of bitterness and piny goodness. Makes me think of Dogfish 60 minute in terms of flavor profile, turned up just a little bit, but not as far as 90.I've been hearing about this middle-of-the-country beer for years and I'm not disappointed having finally tried it!\", 'A staple if you will. Gets better as it warms. Decent IPA. Not too much hops.', 'Not a huge IPA guy, this was ok. A little too hoppy. Won’t buy again', 'Wonderful medium-strength IPA with beautiful and nicely balanced flavors of pine and tropical fruits. Ideal for winter/fall as this beer will warm your souls. A bit heavy for warm days, can feel like a meal.', 'An American pale ale at its most defining characteristic. I’ve grown to love centennial hops and this seems to be available at many stores which, as much as I love local craft brews (especially around Chicago, like 3 Floyds and Revolution), distribution is key for a transient graduate student as myself who loves consistent tasty beers at reasonable prices. This beer holds its freshness compared to other American IPAs which need to be consumed within 6-8 weeks.', \"Bells Two Hearted is a classic IPA that I can't be mad at. It's the kind of beer that I'll happily buy at a bar and not be disappointed. The look of the beer is see through. The smell is mostly a classic balance of hops and malt. The taste and feel is nothing different. There are only a few IPAs that I like better because they have more West Coast hops, but this beer is as reliable and classic as it comes.\", 'Pours a rich gold color, clear with a foamy white head. Smells a little of pine bitterness. Taste is well balanced, caramel malt flavor with a dry bitter finish.', \"For many years I've read about how good this beer is...but it wasn't available. About 2 weeks ago I found it at a local store in the 22 oz can section and couldn't believe my eyes. YES..this beer lives up to all the rave reviews. In a world where there are so many great IPAs...this one stands out.\", \"So darn good had to force it down my mama's throat!\", 'L - Golden with a good amount of clarity and a white head that sticks around a bit, leaving behind a thin cap and some lacingS - juicy, piney, floral hops along with bright tropical fruit notes along with citrus, some maltT - juicy, piney, floral hops up front intermixed well with tropical fruit notes - pineapple, passion fruit, some citrus, along with crackery maltF - medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!', \"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.\", \"What?

Very complex. very bitter and earthy. Possibly the most earthy stout I've ever had. I personally enjoy more sweet stouts where this is very very bitter and woody. However, I believe the complexity and richness speaks to the craft and would be absolutely loved by some.F - Feel is slightly bubbly and thick.O - As stated, I want to like it but it's not quite sweet enough for my tastes, and it's extreme earthiness is beyond my pallet. That said it's enjoyable and worth a try.\", 'Aged leather gives way to notes of strong, dark licorice. There are notes of burnt marshmallow in there, as well as a taste of either ripe plums or fresh Mediterranean figs. With an ABV of over 11%, this beer does not come off as overly boozy, despite its aging in bourbon and French oak barrels. Finally, there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses.This beer will only get better with age. I see this beer as mellowing its edges with another year or two (if you can wait that long), on the shelf, aging.', 'Awesome', 'Unsure of the 99 rating. Wasn\\'t impressed a year ago, and not impressed a year after proper aging. Dark chocolate and leather are present but there is a \"burnt\" characteristic to this that just turns me off. Some astringency as well. Interested to see 1 more year of aging on this to see what happens, otherwise there are plenty of other barrel aged stouts out there I find to be much more preferable.', 'Drinking a 2018 bottle (cellared). This RIS has a roasted malt or grain characteristic which sets it apart from some of the others. It is not a sweet beer with lots of cherries, plums, or fruits. Rather, it is a dry, dark and burnt character leaning towards tart/bitter end of the scale for me. It is like a dry RIS. I like it. More of the bitter Chocolate and Coffee end of the spectrum. It is mellow, and not boozy (for me). Mouth feel is medium, and not too chewy. Just right actually. Looks like motor oil from an old V8 that has not been drained in 20k miles. Reaching for my 2nd one just now. This is a quality product from Deschutes.', '2017 Reserve. Bottled on 10/13/17. Pulled this bottle out my cellar. Was not sure what to expect, but...it is still tasting great! I suspect that the wax over the bottle cap along with the hefty ABV helped. Pours jet black with a frothy coffee colored head. Some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose, but not enough to be offensive. As many other reviews state, there is a lot going on in this offering. Every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that I did not pick out in the previous. The barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it. The nose is the only hint that this beer has just over 5 years on it. Overall, an enjoyable and complex imperial stout.', '12oz bottled 4/28/21 (nearly one year ago) poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 11.8% ABV per label. The beer pours pitch black with no light penetration and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles. Sparce lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring chocolate, roasted malt and oak barrel. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more subtle oak, bitter chocolate and a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. The substantial ABV is well hidden. Overall, very good.', 'No head. Smell is rich dark chocolate, cherry, hints of coffee and bourbon. Lots going on in the mouth— upfront cherry, milk and dark chocolate, hoppy pine bitterness, caramel, oak char, coffee on the finish, and a bit more hops. The barrel is there, though it doesn’t dominate. Feel is thick and smooth. The kind of beer that you can mull over and find all sorts of different things.']   \n",

Pour is as dark as beer comes, with a small amount of short-lived head. Aroma is better than expected given the age. Plenty of cocoa and chocolate with some almost coffee like elements.

Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well.Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat.

Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a poor balance of roasted, caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes, with the cinnamon standing out particularly, as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.\", \"2022 vintage. Cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful.This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick.FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful.Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job.

Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel.

Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV).Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich.Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well.Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming.Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty.\", \"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.Damn I wish I didn't like this as much as I do. There is just no way to justify buying another bottle, but this is absolutely worth trying once.\", '2019 vintagePours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts, warm roasted malts, sweet maple syrup, pecans, walnut, dark dessert wines, port, sherry, madeira, some cognac liquor, cherry, toffee, caramel, bourbon, oaky char, hints of baking chocolate, red grape, mild bitter herbs, caraway, subtle spice, raisins, dark dried fruit, brown bread, fruitcake, and a touch of vanilla. Feels medium-full bodied, slick, oily, strong and smooth. Overall a real great and unique barrel-aged sipper.', 'Had multiple years. Very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer. More like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyable.Great conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly.', \"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this.\"]   \n",

Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into.

No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM.

There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms.

As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful.Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first.\", 'Truly an excellent beer!Bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past March. I decided to have it for Father’s Day!Poured into a tulip glass. Rich, oily dark brown color with a brown head and excellent curtain lacing. Needed to let it warm for the nose to open a bit. Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel. I would love to try the barrel aged version sometime. A great Father’s Day treat!', 'Deep copper with a 1/2\" tan head, which slowly fades. Minimal lacing.Aroma of cinnamon, chocolate, hot pepper, vanilla, caramelly as it warms.Taste is cinnamon, peppers, chocolate, roasty, vanilla stronger on the nose than palate.Full body, light carbonation. Thick &amp; oily finish.Bottled 10/23/17. As expected with a 5 year old high ABV stout, it has little head &amp; minimal lacing. Apart from that, this is a very good Imp Stout.', '202111.5 ABV', 'L: Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter - heavy black pour with very little dark foam risen to the surface.S: Notes of chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, vanilla, cinnamon. Very on point with the description and it’s awesome because you can smell the chili in there as well.T: Wow. Definitely getting the bakers/ milk chocolate upfront along with some vanilla, cinnamon, dark fruits, chili peppers and malts. This is so good!F: Thick, syrupy, heavy bodied, easy to drink. The abv hides very well in this.O: I knew once I read chili it would be a hit or miss because sometimes with other beers you can’t taste it as much but this hits it on point. Great job!', '2021 vintage:Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter.Look- Black, opaque, no visible particulate, dark brown frothy head, slightly below average lacing, average head retention.Smell- Cacao, vanilla, chili pepper, slight Ceylon cinnamon, medium strength of scent.Taste- Cacao, vanilla, chili pepper, Ceylon cinnamon, moderately sweet, mildly spicy, high strength of flavor.Feel- Medium body, highly silky, slightly below average carbonation, highly mouth warming, moderately mouth coating, moderately sweet, mildly spicy.Overall- Black and opaque with average head retention. Bouquet was a fantastic mix of cacao, vanilla, chili pepper and Ceylon cinnamon with medium strength. Taste was a high strength blend of cacao, vanilla, chili pepper and Ceylon cinnamon that was truly delightful. This beer had medium body with high silkiness and mouth warming properties. Overall this beer provided a fantastic experience and is one of the best Stouts I have ever had!', '2022 VintageCONTAINS: LactoseWay too sweet and unbalanced, with some off flavors.', \"Poured into a tulip. Very modest head. Zero lacing. Very dark brown, but not quite black. Essentially opaque. Not as viscous as some of the style.Very pleasant and melded aromas. Chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, and cashew.Roasty but sweet malts on the tip of the tongue. Coffee and nutty/vanilla notes in midstream. Bitterness boosts here to the end. The cinnamon gives way to the ancho warmth at the finish. Hides the booze well.Medium-full bodied but not quite chewy. Modest carbonation but not sticky or cloying.This brew and Bomb! are sixes and sevens for me, and that's a high compliment. This is a more restrained take, with a bit less sweetness and heat and more nutty goodness.\"]</td>\n",

After a short absence, I'm glad to see this beer back. It is still the fine sweet goodness I remember.\", '12oz bottle 2018 vintage that turned up in my LBS this week poured into a chalice at 47°F 11.4% ABV. The beer pours opaque medium brown with light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and little else. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring candi sugar, raisin, bourbon and leather. The taste is semisweet caramel, bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco, oak and leather on the finish. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a semi dry finish. ABV is well hidden with just a touch of heat on the back end and no ethanol aroma or taste. Overall, excellent.', 'Rare 2015 vintage draught pour at Apex Bar in Portland OR.Presented flat. No foam at all. Deep brown, borders on black.Smells great. Dark stone fruits and that famiiar Quad on the nose.Taste is toes on the line too sweet, but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. I think maybe because it’s 7 years old, some if the nuances intended have been lost. But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew.Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.Overall, good to get a draught hit, but 7 years of hiding has worn its beauty down.', '2018 vintage, poured into a FW mini snifter.Dark brown pour with minimal carbonation. Scents of candi sugar, caramel, and dried fruit. Sweet flavor of candy, and a warming finish. Certainly a fine example of the style, and one that aged well.', \"2021 Vintage consumed on 10-30-2022A bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. Dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head, with a fairly aggressive pour. The retention is decent, and there's some lacing on the glass.The aroma is strong with dark fruit - I get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose.Taste - Tons of plum and raisin hit up front. There's a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. I also get a creamy flavor mixing in, almost a lactose flavor. This last thing surprised me, probably not getting it right.The body is very thick and full. Smooth, and very little alcohol burn.I love this beer, and so glad I bought it.\", 'The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.', '2017 vintage... poured from a boxed bottle into a Dogfish Head tulipL: Dark mahogany grown pour... cloudy and with 2 fingers of off-white head.

It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty.\", \"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more.

Absolutely gorgeous imperial stout.I don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent, but this beer’s nose is, with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front, some dark cherries, and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes.The taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes, and they are rich and chewy, moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit, and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer.The mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream. I can’t imagine a more perfect rendering of a BA imperial stout.   \n",
              "25  If Woodford Reserve, Willet and Heavenly Hill were to get together and make a beery baby, they would be so blessed to have this stout. Slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give Anchorage Brewing a love child that can compete with the best.Jet black and pouring like inky tar, Blessed pours with a luscious, ominous and velvety pour. While shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses, chocolate, whisky, oak, coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. Once on the tongue, the immense sweetness of molasses, brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness.As the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds, notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. Trailing into a smooth espresso, cappuccino character, the late taste brings out all of those coconut, toasted oak, vanilla, cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm, sultry and savory set of pleasantries.Full bodied, pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions, the stout is simply magical. It pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. The warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts, vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease.   \n",

Absolutely gorgeous imperial stout.I don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent, but this beer’s nose is, with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front, some dark cherries, and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes.The taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes, and they are rich and chewy, moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit, and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer.The mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream.

Slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give Anchorage Brewing a love child that can compete with the best.Jet black and pouring like inky tar, Blessed pours with a luscious, ominous and velvety pour. While shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses, chocolate, whisky, oak, coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. Once on the tongue, the immense sweetness of molasses, brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness.As the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds, notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. Trailing into a smooth espresso, cappuccino character, the late taste brings out all of those coconut, toasted oak, vanilla, cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm, sultry and savory set of pleasantries.Full bodied, pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions, the stout is simply magical. It pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. The warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts, vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease.</td>\n",
