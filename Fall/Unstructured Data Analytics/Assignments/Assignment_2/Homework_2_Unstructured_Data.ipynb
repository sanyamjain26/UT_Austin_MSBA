It is SARCASTICALLY chocolate, perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion, but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. I love this whenever I'm really in the mood for something rich, but any other time it's a bit much. Great specialty beer.   \n",

The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bitNot surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.   \n",

      "1978  Drank 2 for this rating, one warmed for a few minutes and one straight from the fridgePours somewhere between copper and amber, slightly hazy with a quickly dissipating 3.5 finger khaki headSmells upfront mildly of hops and definitely of malt, maybe a tiny bit of lemon?Tastes very sweet initially, followed by caramel, with an aftertaste of dried fruit, with very little bitterness throughout. I notice more bitterness the more I drink, but it still remains very low. I still taste the caramel notes. During the second bottle I began tasting toast and bread, very good malt tastes in this beer.This is extremely smooth, likely the smoothest non stout/porter I've hadAbsolutely willing to buy this again as a 6 pack, which is how I bought this, to celebrate German beer day. Price was decent so that's another thing in it's favor   \n",

So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!', \"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.\", \"What?

So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!', \"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.\", \"What? I never rated Heady Topper! Great 'tude.

Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well.

Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.\", \"2022 vintage.

The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick.FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background.

It is SARCASTICALLY chocolate, perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion, but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. I love this whenever I'm really in the mood for something rich, but any other time it's a bit much. Great specialty beer.\", \"Almost pure black with a small tan head. The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bitNot surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.\", 'Pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink, smells of coffee with a slight sweetness... black coffee with one sugar. has a medium mouth feel, tastes of bitter coffee, maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe', '12 ounce bottle, poured after warming for 30 minutes, into a Founders snifter.Dark mud coffee black, fine dense brown head that recedes slowly.Aroma of Italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe Cubano. A chocolate note too.Wickedly tasty, leads right off with the coffee. Then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. Finishes mildly sweet, then slightly bitter and dry.Oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. Medium carbonation.Overall, a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘anytime’ treat.', 'I love coffee. I love stouts. I love oatmeal stouts. I usually love coffee stouts. Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.', 'Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.']   \n",

Nose is sappy hops and malt, low grade maple syrup, cooked barley and kasha, honey sticks. Taste essentially follows - malts are sweet (honey, maple, sap), while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice. Mouthfeel, despite the sweetness and heft, isn't too heavy, while the carbonation stays light. 90 Minute tastes like an ingredient to me - it has a distinct taste (sweet, spicy, sappy honey) - that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread. On its own, however, it's a little too overpowering to be enjoyable.

So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!', \"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.\", \"What?

Stout lovers of the world, unite and take over.', 'Had on tap at Bulldog Saloon Lynnwood, WA.', \"I'm rating this based off of the Kentucky Breakfast Stout drop, BeerAdvocate says it's retired but I just grabbed a pack of them last week. It is SARCASTICALLY chocolate, perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion, but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. I love this whenever I'm really in the mood for something rich, but any other time it's a bit much. Great specialty beer.\", \"Almost pure black with a small tan head. The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bitNot surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.\", 'Pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink, smells of coffee with a slight sweetness... black coffee with one sugar. has a medium mouth feel, tastes of bitter coffee, maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe', '12 ounce bottle, poured after warming for 30 minutes, into a Founders snifter.Dark mud coffee black, fine dense brown head that recedes slowly.Aroma of Italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe Cubano. A chocolate note too.Wickedly tasty, leads right off with the coffee. Then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. Finishes mildly sweet, then slightly bitter and dry.Oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. Medium carbonation.Overall, a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘anytime’ treat.', 'I love coffee. I love stouts. I love oatmeal stouts. I usually love coffee stouts. Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.', 'Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.']   \n",

So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!', \"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.\", \"What?

Appearance is a bright translucent yellow with plenty of persistent white head. Aroma, while somewhat muted, is really nice up close. Blind, I might actually think this was a hefeweizen given the clove like esters I'm getting.Taste is more in line with what I was expecting, with lemon & hay and some mixed fruit. Very light and tasty and extraordinarily easy drinking. Absolutely perfect way to end a beautiful long weekend.\", 'Appearance: Faintly cloudy straw-yellow with a slight cap of bubbles on the top that quickly subsided.Smell: Moderate barnyard funk, grassy/hay notes, and mild fruity notes.Taste: Following the hints from the nose, I pick up moderate funk notes, moderate grassy/hay notes, and mild citrus fruit notes. The individual flavors are very distinct from each other but at the same time form a cohesive flavor profile. The beer finishes dry with some mildly bitter grassy/hay notes.Mouth-feel: Light-bodied with a modest level of carbonation.Overall: A very nice Saison. Tasty flavor profile with a light body and dry finish.', 'Cloudy golden body with a white cap that settles into a collar. Grapefruit, lemon, bright oak, faint melon and passion fruit, faint yeast nose. Taste is simpler with big lemon and oak, mild saison yeast, faint ripe tropical fruits. Feel is light and cool, sour and slightly acidic, dries a bit with yeast on finish', 'Bottle: Poured a blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and light vinous notes. Taste is a mix of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and a vinous finish with light oak. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no perceptible alcohol. Enjoyable saison with a nice level of complexity.', 'Pours soft hazy yellow/straw with a massive head and great retention. Nose is primarily brett, lemon, oak, but smells fantastic. Taste is similar to the nose a light tartness from the lemon and hay, funk from the brett, and balance from the oak. The flavors all blend together wonderfully to form a fantastic saison. The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Each taste of the slight tartness invites additional sipping. Just a wonderful farmhouse ale.', 'Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention.Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well.Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual \"wild\" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale\\'s flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with.', 'On tap at Windsor Homebrew in Anaheim, CA.Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all. Maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. So much so that I think that I don’t need Olivia de Haviland because I want them all.I am lost. I am found. I am. I just am.', 'No bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later, released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.', 'Appearance - The beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head.Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent.Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish.Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish.Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.']   \n",

Pour is as dark as beer comes, with a small amount of short-lived head. Aroma is better than expected given the age. Plenty of cocoa and chocolate with some almost coffee like elements. Really nice smelling beer. Taste has also held up really well. Lots of smooth chocolate. Semi-sweet and well balanced with some nice roasted notes. Overall, pretty good beer. I'm impressed with how well this has held up.\", 'Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA2022Served in a Tree House Brewing Company tulipThe beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well.Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat. I feel like many of Tree House’s imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans.']   \n",

Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a poor balance of roasted, caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes, with the cinnamon standing out particularly, as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.\", \"2022 vintage. Cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful.This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick.FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful.Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first.\", 'Truly an excellent beer!Bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past March.

Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel. I would love to try the barrel aged version sometime. A great Father’s Day treat!', 'Deep copper with a 1/2\" tan head, which slowly fades.

The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar.

Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV).Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich.Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well.Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming.Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty.\", \"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.Damn I wish I didn't like this as much as I do. There is just no way to justify buying another bottle, but this is absolutely worth trying once.\", '2019 vintagePours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts, warm roasted malts, sweet maple syrup, pecans, walnut, dark dessert wines, port, sherry, madeira, some cognac liquor, cherry, toffee, caramel, bourbon, oaky char, hints of baking chocolate, red grape, mild bitter herbs, caraway, subtle spice, raisins, dark dried fruit, brown bread, fruitcake, and a touch of vanilla. Feels medium-full bodied, slick, oily, strong and smooth. Overall a real great and unique barrel-aged sipper.', 'Had multiple years. Very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer. More like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyable.Great conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly.', \"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this.\"]   \n",

My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.\", \"What?

Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms.

The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it.

But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew.Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.Overall, good to get a draught hit, but 7 years of hiding has worn its beauty down.', '2018 vintage, poured into a FW mini snifter.Dark brown pour with minimal carbonation. Scents of candi sugar, caramel, and dried fruit. Sweet flavor of candy, and a warming finish. Certainly a fine example of the style, and one that aged well.', \"2021 Vintage consumed on 10-30-2022A bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. Dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head, with a fairly aggressive pour. The retention is decent, and there's some lacing on the glass.The aroma is strong with dark fruit - I get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose.Taste - Tons of plum and raisin hit up front. There's a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. I also get a creamy flavor mixing in, almost a lactose flavor. This last thing surprised me, probably not getting it right.The body is very thick and full. Smooth, and very little alcohol burn.I love this beer, and so glad I bought it.\", 'The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.', '2017 vintage... poured from a boxed bottle into a Dogfish Head tulipL: Dark mahogany grown pour... cloudy and with 2 fingers of off-white head.

       "      <td>[\"2017 vintage - shared with me from a friend. Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV).Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich.Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well.Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming.Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty.\", \"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.Damn I wish I didn't like this as much as I do. There is just no way to justify buying another bottle, but this is absolutely worth trying once.\", '2019 vintagePours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts, warm roasted malts, sweet maple syrup, pecans, walnut, dark dessert wines, port, sherry, madeira, some cognac liquor, cherry, toffee, caramel, bourbon, oaky char, hints of baking chocolate, red grape, mild bitter herbs, caraway, subtle spice, raisins, dark dried fruit, brown bread, fruitcake, and a touch of vanilla. Feels medium-full bodied, slick, oily, strong and smooth. Overall a real great and unique barrel-aged sipper.', 'Had multiple years. Very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer. More like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyable.Great conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly.', \"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this.\"]</td>\n",

There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.\", 'Pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink, smells of coffee with a slight sweetness... black coffee with one sugar. has a medium mouth feel, tastes of bitter coffee, maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe', '12 ounce bottle, poured after warming for 30 minutes, into a Founders snifter.Dark mud coffee black, fine dense brown head that recedes slowly.Aroma of Italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe Cubano. A chocolate note too.Wickedly tasty, leads right off with the coffee. Then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. Finishes mildly sweet, then slightly bitter and dry.Oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. Medium carbonation.Overall, a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘anytime’ treat.', 'I love coffee. I love stouts. I love oatmeal stouts. I usually love coffee stouts. Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.', 'Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.']   \n",

It’s available in the cafe car on most of Amtrak’s long distance services.

Nose is sappy hops and malt, low grade maple syrup, cooked barley and kasha, honey sticks. Taste essentially follows - malts are sweet (honey, maple, sap), while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice. Mouthfeel, despite the sweetness and heft, isn't too heavy, while the carbonation stays light. 90 Minute tastes like an ingredient to me - it has a distinct taste (sweet, spicy, sappy honey) - that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread. On its own, however, it's a little too overpowering to be enjoyable. I remember 90 minute being this huge outlier when it came out, and weirdly, it still is in terms of its flavor profile among imperial IPAs.\", 'Very smooth almost chewy.

Bit coppery color, orange amber, with a thick white head. Very nice start. Old school AIPA aromas of citrus and maybe some pine. Really substantial mouthfeel owing to a solid malt backbone with some crystal malts along with a creamy load of carbonation. Maybe even oats in the mash? But anyway, this is an IPA, and it brings along a very reasonable level of bitterness and piny goodness. Makes me think of Dogfish 60 minute in terms of flavor profile, turned up just a little bit, but not as far as 90.I've been hearing about this middle-of-the-country beer for years and I'm not disappointed having finally tried it!\", 'A staple if you will. Gets better as it warms. Decent IPA. Not too much hops.', 'Not a huge IPA guy, this was ok. A little too hoppy. Won’t buy again', 'Wonderful medium-strength IPA with beautiful and nicely balanced flavors of pine and tropical fruits. Ideal for winter/fall as this beer will warm your souls. A bit heavy for warm days, can feel like a meal.', 'An American pale ale at its most defining characteristic. I’ve grown to love centennial hops and this seems to be available at many stores which, as much as I love local craft brews (especially around Chicago, like 3 Floyds and Revolution), distribution is key for a transient graduate student as myself who loves consistent tasty beers at reasonable prices. This beer holds its freshness compared to other American IPAs which need to be consumed within 6-8 weeks.', \"Bells Two Hearted is a classic IPA that I can't be mad at. It's the kind of beer that I'll happily buy at a bar and not be disappointed. The look of the beer is see through. The smell is mostly a classic balance of hops and malt. The taste and feel is nothing different. There are only a few IPAs that I like better because they have more West Coast hops, but this beer is as reliable and classic as it comes.\", 'Pours a rich gold color, clear with a foamy white head. Smells a little of pine bitterness. Taste is well balanced, caramel malt flavor with a dry bitter finish.', \"For many years I've read about how good this beer is...but it wasn't available. About 2 weeks ago I found it at a local store in the 22 oz can section and couldn't believe my eyes. YES..this beer lives up to all the rave reviews.

So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!', \"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.\", \"What?

Appearance is a bright translucent yellow with plenty of persistent white head. Aroma, while somewhat muted, is really nice up close. Blind, I might actually think this was a hefeweizen given the clove like esters I'm getting.Taste is more in line with what I was expecting, with lemon & hay and some mixed fruit. Very light and tasty and extraordinarily easy drinking. Absolutely perfect way to end a beautiful long weekend.\", 'Appearance: Faintly cloudy straw-yellow with a slight cap of bubbles on the top that quickly subsided.Smell: Moderate barnyard funk, grassy/hay notes, and mild fruity notes.Taste: Following the hints from the nose, I pick up moderate funk notes, moderate grassy/hay notes, and mild citrus fruit notes. The individual flavors are very distinct from each other but at the same time form a cohesive flavor profile. The beer finishes dry with some mildly bitter grassy/hay notes.Mouth-feel: Light-bodied with a modest level of carbonation.Overall: A very nice Saison. Tasty flavor profile with a light body and dry finish.', 'Cloudy golden body with a white cap that settles into a collar. Grapefruit, lemon, bright oak, faint melon and passion fruit, faint yeast nose. Taste is simpler with big lemon and oak, mild saison yeast, faint ripe tropical fruits. Feel is light and cool, sour and slightly acidic, dries a bit with yeast on finish', 'Bottle: Poured a blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and light vinous notes. Taste is a mix of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and a vinous finish with light oak. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no perceptible alcohol. Enjoyable saison with a nice level of complexity.', 'Pours soft hazy yellow/straw with a massive head and great retention. Nose is primarily brett, lemon, oak, but smells fantastic. Taste is similar to the nose a light tartness from the lemon and hay, funk from the brett, and balance from the oak. The flavors all blend together wonderfully to form a fantastic saison. The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Each taste of the slight tartness invites additional sipping. Just a wonderful farmhouse ale.', 'Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention.Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well.Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual \"wild\" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale\\'s flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with.', 'On tap at Windsor Homebrew in Anaheim, CA.Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all. Maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. So much so that I think that I don’t need Olivia de Haviland because I want them all.I am lost. I am found. I am. I just am.', 'No bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later, released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.', 'Appearance - The beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head.Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent.Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish.Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish.Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.']   \n",

Pour is as dark as beer comes, with a small amount of short-lived head. Aroma is better than expected given the age. Plenty of cocoa and chocolate with some almost coffee like elements. Really nice smelling beer. Taste has also held up really well. Lots of smooth chocolate. Semi-sweet and well balanced with some nice roasted notes. Overall, pretty good beer. I'm impressed with how well this has held up.\", 'Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA2022Served in a Tree House Brewing Company tulipThe beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well.Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat. I feel like many of Tree House’s imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans.']   \n",

Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a poor balance of roasted, caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes, with the cinnamon standing out particularly, as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.\", \"2022 vintage. Cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful.This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick.FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful.Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first.\", 'Truly an excellent beer!Bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past March.

Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel. I would love to try the barrel aged version sometime. A great Father’s Day treat!', 'Deep copper with a 1/2\" tan head, which slowly fades.

The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar.

Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV).Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich.Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well.Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming.Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty.\", \"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.Damn I wish I didn't like this as much as I do. There is just no way to justify buying another bottle, but this is absolutely worth trying once.\", '2019 vintagePours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts, warm roasted malts, sweet maple syrup, pecans, walnut, dark dessert wines, port, sherry, madeira, some cognac liquor, cherry, toffee, caramel, bourbon, oaky char, hints of baking chocolate, red grape, mild bitter herbs, caraway, subtle spice, raisins, dark dried fruit, brown bread, fruitcake, and a touch of vanilla. Feels medium-full bodied, slick, oily, strong and smooth. Overall a real great and unique barrel-aged sipper.', 'Had multiple years. Very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer. More like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyable.Great conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly.', \"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this.\"]   \n",

dark stout beer well well well well well stout lovers of the world unite and take over had on tap at bulldog saloon lynnwood wa im rating this based off of the kentucky breakfast stout drop beeradvocate says its retired but i just grabbed a pack of them last week it is sarcastically chocolate perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming i love this whenever im really in the mood for something rich but any other time its a bit much great specialty beer almost pure black with a small tan head the bubbles dissipate pretty fast leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacingvery strong coffee smell there is a hint of chocolate helping to balance things a bitnot surprisingly there is a strong coffee note up front then the chocolate sweetness kicks in there is a lingering bitterness at the finishit is a bit thinner than expected mostly carbonation on the tonguei can see how this is the base for the kbs beers it is pretty solid with so much coffee flavor id consider this a dessert beer its good but i definitely prefer the kbs variants pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink smells of coffee with a slight sweetness black coffee with one sugar has a medium mouth feel tastes of bitter coffee maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe 12 ounce bottle poured after warming for 30 minutes into a founders snifterdark mud coffee black fine dense brown head that recedes slowlyaroma of italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe cubano a chocolate note toowickedly tasty leads right off with the coffee then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth finishes mildly sweet then slightly bitter and dryoats delivers a fine creamy smoothness medium carbonationoverall a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘ anytime ’ treat i love coffee i love stouts i love oatmeal stouts i usually love coffee stouts given all that i expected to love the 2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking unfortunately i didn ’ t the coffee smell is above average but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long this one is not for me poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glassappearance very dark brown nearly black with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass moderate lacingnose dark roast stone fruit brown sugar coffee — there ’ s a lot going on heremouthfeel creamy moderately thickattack dark roast coffee chocolate smooth — plenty going on here toofinish alcohol and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfullyoverall it ’ s hard to imagine how an american oatmeal stout could be any better than this — so full smooth and wellbalanced there ’ s nothing i ’ d rather drink with biscuits and gravy but it ’ s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs this beer deserves every bit of its high ratings  \n",

ipataste intense balanced and hopforwardcolor deep ambera standout example of the ipa style pours a deep amber intense and well balancedstrong hop blends pine citrus and resinous hops memorable impression one of my favourites i came across this on a recent rail tour of the us it ’ s available in the cafe car on most of amtrak ’ s long distance services it looks like there ’ s no requirement to state the abv of beers at the point of sale as i didn ’ t realise it was 9 til i had the first sip lovely stuff though sadly not available in the uk one of my favorite dipa ish ipas it has a wonderful full bodied dipa taste but doesnt hit you like a higher alcohol ipa i love the higher ibu that seems to be lacking in many ipas these days look sap color orangesmell hoppy malty slightly citrusy and piney hoptaste piney hop rind pithe malt some sweetness in there slight bitterness that starts to build up but then just kinda doesnt if that makes any sense feel nice full boy low carbonation the feel of this beer might be my favorite thing about it overall pretty crushable fairly tame nothing too offensive that being said nothing stands out but i suppose you could also say that just means its well balanced not my cup for ipas but good poured from a can on clearance that expires in 4 months so i def think this needs a revisit with a fresh brew pours an opaque rusty orange thin collar of head with good retention and no lacing nose is sappy hops and malt low grade maple syrup cooked barley and kasha honey sticks taste essentially follows malts are sweet honey maple sap while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice mouthfeel despite the sweetness and heft isnt too heavy while the carbonation stays light 90 minute tastes like an ingredient to me it has a distinct taste sweet spicy sappy honey that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread on its own however its a little too overpowering to be enjoyable i remember 90 minute being this huge outlier when it came out and weirdly it still is in terms of its flavor profile among imperial ipas very smooth almost chewy my 1st time with this world class ipa today and i am impressed the alcohol is there and you should be prepared for it but overall the taste smell finish and mouth feel was excellent from siciliano ’ s market in grand rapids had several times but now a few years will not wait that long againpours a clear orange amber colour with slightly tawny coloured head that replenishes nicely with a little swirlnose is at once hoppy with citrus rind tangerine a touch of tropical fruit and floral aroma but solidly malty with a subtle caramel notetaste is a barrage of hops piney citrus orange pineapple and marmalade with a bitterness that is tamed by the sweet toasted malt with hints of caramel and honeysucklea sticky slightly resinous full mouthfeel finishes this with a coating bittersweetness easily my favorite imperial ipa and possibly ipa periodpours a beautiful crystal clear amber color with a tanwhite head that long persists as a rimaroma is very strongly floral and earthydespite being rated as 90 ibus this is not a bitter beer thanks to the adequate amount of malt being added to balance the hops the flavor is citrusy and earth with a crisp finish making this an easy drinking beer despite its high abvreally just the ideal poster child for the style of ipas as a whole 12 ounce bottle poured into a snulipbest by 7 2023l clear amber two fingers of antiquewhite head the persistent foam leaves laces kind of a malty aroma with notes of citrus and pinet earthy hops with less citrus than the nose but grapefruit and pine medium sweet malt herbal tea note nice malthop balance moderate bitterness spikes at the finishf medium body moderate carbonation smooth frothy feel peppery finisho very drinkable balanced well done classic style dipa  \n",

like it so it ’ s my goto beer when campingreasonably priced in my area 12oz can with date code 062823 served in a pint glass bit coppery color orange amber with a thick white head very nice start old school aipa aromas of citrus and maybe some pine really substantial mouthfeel owing to a solid malt backbone with some crystal malts along with a creamy load of carbonation maybe even oats in the mash but anyway this is an ipa and it brings along a very reasonable level of bitterness and piny goodness makes me think of dogfish 60 minute in terms of flavor profile turned up just a little bit but not as far as 90ive been hearing about this middleofthecountry beer for years and im not disappointed having finally tried it a staple if you will gets better as it warms decent ipa not too much hops not a huge ipa guy this was ok a little too hoppy won ’ t buy again wonderful mediumstrength ipa with beautiful and nicely balanced flavors of pine and tropical fruits ideal for winter fall as this beer will warm your souls a bit heavy for warm days can feel like a meal an american pale ale at its most defining characteristic i ’ ve grown to love centennial hops and this seems to be available at many stores which as much as i love local craft brews especially around chicago like 3 floyds and revolution distribution is key for a transient graduate student as myself who loves consistent tasty beers at reasonable prices this beer holds its freshness compared to other american ipas which need to be consumed within 68 weeks bells two hearted is a classic ipa that i cant be mad at its the kind of beer that ill happily buy at a bar and not be disappointed the look of the beer is see through the smell is mostly a classic balance of hops and malt the taste and feel is nothing different there are only a few ipas that i like better because they have more west coast hops but this beer is as reliable and classic as it comes pours a rich gold color clear with a foamy white head smells a little of pine bitterness taste is well balanced caramel malt flavor with a dry bitter finish for many years ive read about how good this beer is but it wasnt available about 2 weeks ago i found it at a local store in the 22 oz can section and couldnt believe my eyes yes this beer lives up to all the rave reviews in a world where there are so many great ipas this one stands out so darn good had to force it down my mamas throat l golden with a good amount of clarity and a white head that sticks around a bit leaving behind a thin cap and some lacings juicy piney floral hops along with bright tropical fruit notes along with citrus some maltt juicy piney floral hops up front intermixed well with tropical fruit notes pineapple passion fruit some citrus along with crackery maltf medium bodied with moderate carbonation juicyo a very well balanced classic ipa  \n",

to have finally gotten my hands on it solid served in an imperial nonic pint glassthis beer pours a golden hue and is topped with a couple inches of offwhite head that leaves nice lacingit has a real nice fruity citrus aroma i get a little pinenice balance of citrus and pine flavors a little bit of lingering resin in the finishvery good iipa its one of the pioneers as with all trailblazers newer and better beers come along i live in ohio and am very happy that i can drink hop juju someday it too will be a trailblazer in the rearview mirror of my lifelong beer trek pliny is really difficult to find in southern cal but i finally tried one for the first time at the russian river brew pub in santa rosa it was on tap so super fresh i think it is probably the most well balanced dipa i ever tried i now understand the hype an excellent brew without taking anything away from pliny i prefer heady topper sip of sunshine my first pliny 2 week old bottle so quite fresh extremely well dialed in almost leaves a piney resin on your lips and tongue  \n",

has already been said but it just has an unbelievable balance and a je ne sais quoi that is extremely satisfying to enjoy a beer that elevates the experience from a tasty beverage to something to transform the simple act of drinking into something more thought provoking also for me it is much more balanced than focal which some prefer cheers poured from a 16 ounce can dated 73123 into a teku glasslook medium gold very hazy frothy white head above average head retention and lacingsmell pine resin clementine nectarine dank earthy medium strength of scenttaste pine resin clementine pithy pineapple herbaceous high strength of flavorfeel between medium and full body average carbonation highly creamy moderately bitter mildly mouth warming mildly dry finishoverall medium gold and very hazy with above average head retention and lacing bouquet was medium strength with notes of pine resin clementine nectarine and dankness flavor was a great mix of pine resin clementine pith and pineapple feel was between medium and full body mildly mouth warming and highly creamy overall this beer provided a great drinking experience and was much more of a mix between a west coast ipa and neipa than a true neipa from todays standards l hazy yellow golden with a frothy white head that sticks around leaving behind a good amount of lacings bright fresh piney resinous bitter floral hops malt and grasst fresh piney resinous floral bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with malt and cracker notes along with grass as well as citrus grapefruit and apricot dank on the backendf medium bodied with moderate carbonation crisp refreshingo an incredibly well rounded imperial ipa yeah ok it ’ s very good great hop flavor price point is a bit much but def worth the investment now and again so seek it out if you can find it and enjoy i had a chance to visit the brewery and have heady topper on tap and bring a few home for a more in depth tastingaside from knowing its fame i knew little else my first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as i expected secondly upon tasting i was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western ipa than an neipa not that its a bad thing im just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you can not see into most of my experience is with ny based neipas which do seem a bit different than vermontsmell it seemed more floral than fruity the alcohol content also shone through a bittaste wow no ibu rating on can but this has to be 60 but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste the flavor really helps balance the bitterness the pine and resin was strong albeit weaker than some great west coast ipas i have had this was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify no massive grapefruit or citrus flavor i could identify maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt descriptionthe aftertaste was dark damp and lasting in a great way to me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer the stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was dark but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked byand i must say i loved the brewery beautiful and great staff i literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it my only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area the food options were not strong and it closes at 6pm another downside lol was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes i only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour what i never rated heady topper great tude greater vtmy sister brings this to me from vta hazed golden standard with lace and last tho brewer encourages us to drink from can which in a taste test turns out to be great advices baked good floating an herbal piney floral seat follows aroma through the full see saw of sweet and bitter woody earthy piney dank floralf smooth tongue kissyo deserves its pinnacle marks the original beer is incredibly hoppy and flavorful strong dank tones this beer is good  \n",

syrup the mouthfeel is lush and sticky 153 well done canned november 2019 pour is as dark as beer comes with a small amount of shortlived head aroma is better than expected given the age plenty of cocoa and chocolate with some almost coffee like elements really nice smelling beer taste has also held up really well lots of smooth chocolate semisweet and well balanced with some nice roasted notes overall pretty good beer im impressed with how well this has held up drank from a 1 pint can purchased at tree house brewing company charlton ma2022served in a tree house brewing company tulipthe beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue an inchtall tight and creamy mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick lasting collar streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glassthe aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time moderately roasty with dayold coffee notes bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too as the beer sat sweet creamy lactose notes appeared good dose of vanilla as well chocolate syrup was also noticeable the sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer satthe flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose malty and robust up front roasted malts were most apparent moderate caramel malt presence too cold coffee was also noticeable subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center slightly sweet more roastiness on the back end and the finish moderate amount of bitterness some alcohol warmth came through as wellnice creamy smooth mouthfeel medium bodied for the style slightly syrupy the liquid contained a finer beaded somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palateall that is and all that ever will be is an enjoyable beer though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat i feel like many of tree house ’ s imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans  \n",

fizzy head smells of roasted caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas with hints of vanilla coming through as well taste follows the nose with a poor balance of roasted caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes with the cinnamon standing out particularly as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis finishes bittersweet with a medium sweetness light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste full mouthfeel with a medium rich body and carbonationba abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that i have ever tasted and perhaps unsurprisingly the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that i already disliked for the barrelaged version its basically a total cinnamon bomb the cinnamon being way too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon theres hints of vanilla as well but next to no chili heat coming through which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness at least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet but i have had plenty of much better mexican imperial stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me i will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here rich and velvety while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms also the abv is very wellhidden this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow this is by no means a bad beer just feels more like a pastry stout than a mexican stout to me 2022 vintage cacao and a hint of chili on the nose taking a first sip the cacao really pops a light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows the chili isnt spicy but its flavorfulthis is a fantastic imperial stout at first i thought this might be a little too sweet but as i drink more its really not the sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the bakers chocolate as well as the cinnamon and i can see why they did it i might have dialed it back just a hair but thats a nitpickfull bodied nice and thick like an imperial stout should be almost chewy as the beer gets warmer the cinnamon gets more noticeablelong after a sip vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background wonderfuloverall this is one of the very best imperial stouts ive had excellent job i will buy a few more of these and see how they age assuming i can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first truly an excellent beer bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past march i decided to have it for father ’ s day poured into a tulip glass rich oily dark brown color with a brown head and excellent curtain lacing needed to let it warm for the nose to open a bit smell of dark chocolate cinnamon vanilla and chili pepper follows to the taste initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed this transitioned to stronger chocolate cinnamon vanilla the chili also becomes stronger as it warms apricot and cream seriously pleasant booze and malt background flavors are so nicely woven together luxuriant smooth feel i would love to try the barrel aged version sometime a great father ’ s day treat deep copper with a 1 2

orpresented flat no foam at all deep brown borders on blacksmells great dark stone fruits and that famiiar quad on the nosetaste is toes on the line too sweet but it doesn ’ t become cloying or

the wooden oaky barrel aroma is distinct it ’ s clearly a barrelaged strong alethe beer is full bodied velvety latte creamy with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue the beer is moderate sweet it ’ s 2016 bottle 6 years later it ’ s still not dry with a bold palate with a bit sour tart cherry light bitter and subtle salty at back the taste is great renders the beer bold but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad which should be drier to me the malty backbone is strong and there ’ s dark sugar turbinado brown sugar from mexico added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints when i sip i sense some dark chocolate roasted chestnut nutty alcohol burn salted toffee candy leather and tobacco earthiness whiskey filled chocolate bottle dried fig and raisin aromas the beer taste bold very malty and dark sugar characters but it ’ s not ester heavy nor fruity my feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile but just sitting still and sipping cigar this is a malty beverage really malty i think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow i expect more layers in this beer but currently it ’ s just a bit too sweet malty to enjoy 2017

                                                      2017 vintage shared with me from a friend small 2oz pour for each of us served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glassappearance clear dark ambercopper color no lacing there wouldnt be at this abv smell boozy bourbon barrel notes honey toffee richtaste lots going on definitely some barleywine notes with some bourbon oak vanilla toffee honey orange raisin and some bitter notes at the finish as wellmouthfeel surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol good thickness no carbonation dry finish and only a little warmingoverall drinkability i can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer and i almost want to call it a barleybrandy its got aspects of a barleywine but so much more glad i got a taste of it not sure i could finish a large glass of this though definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer unique and quite tasty i opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago this is my third pour time for a reviewi love how hybridized this is it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor i can see calling this barleywine on steroids beautiful cogn armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more smokey wood and tobacco raisin plum schnapps plenty of brown liquor hints of vanilla and honey plus just so much more the body is wonderfully sticky and viscousdamn i wish i didnt like this as much as i do there is just no way to justify buying another bottle but this is absolutely worth trying once 2019 vintagepours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts warm roasted malts sweet maple syrup pecans walnut dark dessert wines port sherry madeira some cognac liquor cherry toffee caramel bourbon oaky char hints of baking chocolate red grape mild bitter herbs caraway subtle spice raisins dark dried fruit brown bread fruitcake and a touch of vanilla feels mediumfull bodied slick oily strong and smooth overall a real great and unique barrelaged sipper had multiple years very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer more like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyablegreat conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly not sure its worth the price tag but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype its super solid and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine but its its own animal definitely glad to tick this  \n",

There were many great beers sample, many beautiful and exquisite dark beers, but nothing quite like this legendary beer. If ever you have a chance to try this one, all I can say is don't pass it up.

Notes of cocoa, molasses, licorice, cherry cola, and maple syrup. The bourbon/barrel was, surprisingly, quite understated. Full body, almost syrupy, with good carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. This finishes cleanly, with hints of roasted malt, maple syrup, and molasses lingering on the finish. This was incredibly easy drinking and not at all boozy despite the high ABV, and it was so good that I wanted to lick the glass clean. World class all the way.</td>\n",

       "3  A small pour, ebony dark, no real head. Intense, rich aroma, brownies and German chocolate cake; dark sweetness. The taste amplifies the smell with the addition of sublime Kentucky bourbon. Heavy body; dense, chewy residual sugar feel with a sublime whiskey heat.This beauty was generously provided by @azuelke (Adam) at a bottle share hosted by @GreenBayBA in Sheboygan, WI. There were many great beers sample, many beautiful and exquisite dark beers, but nothing quite like this legendary beer. If ever you have a chance to try this one, all I can say is don't pass it up. The beer lives up to its legendary status.Pouring temperature: n/a; bottling info: unknown year, bottle number #138Source: @azuelke (Adam), Sheboygan, WI bottle share   \n",

Opaque deep blackish brown in color, with garnet highlights and a wisp of tan head. Where to start? Notes of cocoa, molasses, licorice, cherry cola, and maple syrup. The bourbon/barrel was, surprisingly, quite understated. Full body, almost syrupy, with good carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. This finishes cleanly, with hints of roasted malt, maple syrup, and molasses lingering on the finish. This was incredibly easy drinking and not at all boozy despite the high ABV, and it was so good that I wanted to lick the glass clean. World class all the way.   \n",

It is SARCASTICALLY chocolate, perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion, but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. I love this whenever I'm really in the mood for something rich, but any other time it's a bit much. Great specialty beer.   \n",

The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bitNot surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.   \n",

The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.   \n",
       "766  Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.   \n",

It is SARCASTICALLY chocolate, perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion, but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. I love this whenever I'm really in the mood for something rich, but any other time it's a bit much. Great specialty beer.   \n",

The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bitNot surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.   \n",

A chocolate note too.Wickedly tasty, leads right off with the coffee. Then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. Finishes mildly sweet, then slightly bitter and dry.Oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. Medium carbonation.Overall, a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘anytime’ treat.   \n",

I love stouts. I love oatmeal stouts. I usually love coffee stouts. Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.   \n",
       "8    Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.   \n",

I notice more bitterness the more I drink, but it still remains very low. I still taste the caramel notes. During the second bottle I began tasting toast and bread, very good malt tastes in this beer.This is extremely smooth, likely the smoothest non stout/porter I've hadAbsolutely willing to buy this again as a 6 pack, which is how I bought this, to celebrate German beer day.

Very bright herbal and hay like aroma, toasty cracker, and sweet bread dough. The taste is spicy, herbal and fresh, with a toasty/bready malt backbone, moderate body and clean, drying finish. Very flavorful and quaffable. I don't really know exactly what a Dortmunder-Style Lager is supposed to taste like, but this is world-class beer.   \n",

I notice more bitterness the more I drink, but it still remains very low. I still taste the caramel notes. During the second bottle I began tasting toast and bread, very good malt tastes in this beer.This is extremely smooth, likely the smoothest non stout/porter I've hadAbsolutely willing to buy this again as a 6 pack, which is how I bought this, to celebrate German beer day. Price was decent so that's another thing in it's favor   \n",
