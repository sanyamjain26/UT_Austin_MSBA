Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Amazing stout, expensive but worth the price!",4.75
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,This beer meet and exceeded all the unreal hype. It is simply amazing!,4.52
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,Let it sit and warm to the room a little ... unbelievable.,5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"A small pour, ebony dark, no real head. Intense, rich aroma, brownies and German chocolate cake; dark sweetness. The taste amplifies the smell with the addition of sublime Kentucky bourbon. Heavy body; dense, chewy residual sugar feel with a sublime whiskey heat.This beauty was generously provided by @azuelke (Adam) at a bottle share hosted by @GreenBayBA in Sheboygan, WI. There were many great beers sample, many beautiful and exquisite dark beers, but nothing quite like this legendary beer. If ever you have a chance to try this one, all I can say is don't pass it up. The beer lives up to its legendary status.Pouring temperature: n/a; bottling info: unknown year, bottle number #138Source: @azuelke (Adam), Sheboygan, WI bottle share",5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Vintage 2022, served on tap at Toppling Goliath in a ""snulip"" glass. Opaque deep blackish brown in color, with garnet highlights and a wisp of tan head. Where to start? Notes of cocoa, molasses, licorice, cherry cola, and maple syrup. The bourbon/barrel was, surprisingly, quite understated. Full body, almost syrupy, with good carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. This finishes cleanly, with hints of roasted malt, maple syrup, and molasses lingering on the finish. This was incredibly easy drinking and not at all boozy despite the high ABV, and it was so good that I wanted to lick the glass clean. World class all the way.",4.96
Vanilla Bean Assassin,"12oz bottle…2022 version. Drank 12/25/22.Pours dark brown/black, not much carbonation. Smells of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and barrel. Taste is marshmallows soaked in bourbon. Perfect sweetness. If there is a knock it’s slightly on the thin side, but that’s being picky. Probably the best adjunct stout I’ve had. Truly lives up to the hype.",5
Marshmallow Handjee,09/11/23 draft @ Winking Lizard Canton,4.71
Marshmallow Handjee,"2022 vintage, bottle 1316/3500Another milestone review, number 1800! I figured since I have the highest rated RIS on BA just sitting around that it would be a perfect time to break it out. This is my first of any Dark Lord variant, and I think it’s a damn good place to start for the series. Let’s pop this legend open and see what it has to offerPours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacingThe roast is real in this one, but it’s wonderfully offset by the sweeter notes as well. I’m picking up on aromas of drip coffee, burnt caramel, dark toast, milk chocolate, tobacco, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, fig, and light cinnamonIt’s similar in taste, but with even more of a depth, making this one hell of a complex beer. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, vanilla bean, sweetened coffee, toasted oak, fig, maple syrup, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, black cherry, and marshmallow. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, charred oak, maple syrup, burnt caramel, black cherry, fig, vanilla bean, allspice, sweet bourbon, marshmallow, dark toast, and tobaccoA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of boozy heatOh yeah, this is amazing. Thankfully a beer that lives up to the hype. Maybe one day I’ll splurge on another bottle",4.75
Marshmallow Handjee,"2019 bottle, purple sparkle wax. Pours black with minimal head, no retention. Nose rich vanilla, fruity with strawberry, graham cracker. Taste boozy, chocolate, toasted marshmallow. Full body and minimal carbonation.",4.75

Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"750ml waxed and capped bottle into a DDG teku.Pours thick, viscous. No head, no lace. Big, mocha colored legs. Spice and cinnamon sugar are apparent on the nose. Also notes of chocolate, fudge, molasses, and booze. Very pungent. Beer opens chocolate, fudge, and cinnamon sugar. Spicy and prickly. Vanilla and barrel in the middle. Oak, booze, and more molasses and fudge at the end. Sticky finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Smooth and rich on the palate and goes down messy with a lingering aftertaste.I'm actually less of a fan of this than other imperial stouts in Perennial's barrel aged series. That being said, still far better than average.",4.19
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Excellent rye barrel with strong taste of cinnamon. Hints of cocoa nibs, ancho, and vanilla are pushed into the background by the barrel flavor, which dominates the other flavors. It is very good, but personally I slightly prefer the greater nuance of the regular Abraxis.",4.84
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,Cinnamon and pepper the predominant notes. Cocoa and the barrel aged bourbon sweetness add on the balance the spiciness. Very well done adjuncted BA stout.,4.83
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,Good. Not noticeably better than normal abraxas. Id say overly sweet per style and too mich cinnamon. #3 beer on beer advocate LMAO no.Okay. Fuck. The more I drink this the more I can barely finish the 9oz pour. Sugar cinnamon water. Cloying and WAY fucking 2 dimensional and cloying.,4.64
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"LONG time want of mine! 2016 vintage. Unfortunately, most of the cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon has faded already. All that remains is the apple brandy, and strong ancho chilies. Spicy burn on finish. I’m sure it’s a shell of its former self.",4.51
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Bottle share thx to Hopelessly0.,3.68
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Review was for OG, not rerelease.",4.48
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"This amazing beer combines tobacco, peppers, vanilla, and what tastes like brandy into the quintessential barrel aged beer that pours perfectly and combines amazing mouthfeel, carb and taste",4.27
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"2016 Vintage - Drank 02/24/21Smell -pleasant with notes of tobacco and chocolateTaste - The tobacco over powers this one in the beginning. And then as it warms, the peppers take over. Very unique taste, and I think it’s the brandy barrel influence.Feel - thin, and I expected moreOverall - for being the #4 overall beer on BA, I expected more, much more. The feel was thin, and notes of pepper overpowered this. Yet it was not completely unenjoyable, just not even close to the 4th best beer in the world. Regardless, glad I gut to try it as it’s always nice to see what the hype is about. This one just didn’t live up to it",5
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,2016 was worth it. 2014 idk man,4.77
Blessed,"2021 editiion, drank May 2022. So sweet, even the small bottle was a lot to drink solo. Ten Years was much more balanced.",4.93
Blessed,"Pours squid ink black and settles in the glass like a black velvet cloak, stopping all light, sitting under a sudsy dark tan head that dissipates quickly, as expected with a beer of this gravity. Absolutely gorgeous imperial stout.I don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent, but this beer’s nose is, with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front, some dark cherries, and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes.The taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes, and they are rich and chewy, moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit, and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer.The mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream. I can’t imagine a more perfect rendering of a BA imperial stout.",4.75
Blessed,"If Woodford Reserve, Willet and Heavenly Hill were to get together and make a beery baby, they would be so blessed to have this stout. Slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give Anchorage Brewing a love child that can compete with the best.Jet black and pouring like inky tar, Blessed pours with a luscious, ominous and velvety pour. While shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses, chocolate, whisky, oak, coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. Once on the tongue, the immense sweetness of molasses, brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness.As the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds, notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. Trailing into a smooth espresso, cappuccino character, the late taste brings out all of those coconut, toasted oak, vanilla, cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm, sultry and savory set of pleasantries.Full bodied, pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions, the stout is simply magical. It pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. The warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts, vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease.",4.75
Blessed,Top tier.,5
Blessed,05/20/23 bottle @ Mimi’s house AVL,4.61
Blessed,"2022 bottle, thick like motor oil, black, sweet, boozy, opaque, chocolate, dark fruits. Minimal carbonation that is appropriate for the style. Smooth barrel.",5
Blessed,"2022 Vintage. Blessed is an excellent beer that has a rich, full-bodied taste of dark chocolate and vanilla / marshmallow. Nice thick viscosity and mouthfeel, with a strong chocolate aroma, and easy to drink and enjoy. One of the better beers I've had from Anchorage. I think it's a little overrated on this list, but that's not really a slight - probably more preference than anything. I fail to see how anyone could be disappointed with a pour of Blessed.",5

Heady Topper,"For me this is the GOAT. Don’t want to repeat what has already been said, but it just has an unbelievable balance and a je ne sais quoi that is extremely satisfying to enjoy. A beer that elevates the experience from a tasty beverage to something to transform the simple act of drinking into something more thought provoking. Also, for me it is much more balanced than Focal, which some prefer. Cheers.",4.83
Heady Topper,"Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 7-31-23 into a teku glass.Look- Medium gold, very hazy, frothy white head, above average head retention and lacing.Smell- Pine resin, clementine, nectarine, dank, earthy, medium strength of scent.Taste- Pine resin, clementine, pithy, pineapple, herbaceous, high strength of flavor.Feel- Between medium and full body, average carbonation, highly creamy, moderately bitter, mildly mouth warming, mildly dry finish.Overall- Medium gold and very hazy with above average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was medium strength with notes of pine resin, clementine, nectarine and dankness. Flavor was a great mix of pine resin, clementine, pith and pineapple. Feel was between medium and full body, mildly mouth warming and highly creamy. Overall this beer provided a great drinking experience and was much more of a mix between a West Coast IPA and NEIPA, than a true NEIPA from todays standards.",4.31
Heady Topper,"L - Hazy, yellow golden with a frothy white head that sticks around leaving behind a good amount of lacingS - Bright, fresh, piney, resinous, bitter, floral hops. Malt and grass.T - Fresh, piney, resinous, floral, bitter hops up front and throughout, intermixed well with malt and cracker notes along with grass as well as citrus - grapefruit - and apricot Dank on the backendF - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp, refreshingO - An incredibly well rounded imperial IPA.",4.5
Heady Topper,Yeah ok it’s very good. Great hop flavor. Price point is a bit much but def worth the investment now and again. So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!,4.75
Heady Topper,"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.",4.7
Heady Topper,"What? I never rated Heady Topper! Great 'tude. Greater Vt.My sister brings this to me from Vt.a) Hazed golden standard with lace and last - tho brewer encourages us to drink from can, which in a taste test turns out to be great advice.s) Baked good floating an herbal, piney, floral sea.t) Follows aroma through the full see saw of sweet and bitter, woody, earthy, piney, dank, floral.f) Smooth, tongue kissy.o) Deserves it's pinnacle marks.",4.71
Heady Topper,The original! Beer is incredibly hoppy and flavorful strong dank tones. This beer is good.,5
O.W.K.,"B2. Served at SP from bottle. Waited for it to warm for awhile. Pitch black. Nice balance of bourbon and vanilla on the nose. Complex beer. Starts off with bourbon forward, then vanilla comes in very subtlety and finishes with delicious chocolate. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Would’ve liked it heavier some. Vanilla is there but subtle showcasing the barrel. I would’ve liked more vanilla however.",4.6
Mornin' Delight,I don't know about first thing in morning ... but then again ...,4.27
Mornin' Delight,"On tap at O’Shea Homebrew in San Juan Capistrano, CA.If the sugar plum fairy and Cookie Monster made a baby, I’m sure this is what Mrs. Plum Fairy would lactate. I mean, damn…we are talking sweet. That said, it’s all kinds of balanced and on point like nailing a bullseye at darts before you drain your first beer… What is Raul getting at here? Yeah, he doesn’t play darts. MD is good, but not Raul’s thing. I guess that’s what I meant. Happy to try it (unlike my one and only time at Raising Canes), but I’ll happily move on after having it.",5
Mornin' Delight,"What's not to like about this beer? From the time I opened it, until I finished the last sip, the aroma in the room was that of maple and coffee! It was like a dessert being prepared before you and the scent lingering in trying to attract you. It's mouthwatering to an extent. This is one of those things in life that tastes just like it smells. ""Delight"" is exactly what it is! I am thankful they upped the limits this year, because it's hard to keep my hands off the bottles when I open the fridge. Cheers!",4.29
Mornin' Delight,"Appearance - The beer was black in appearance with a smooth body that showed little visible carbonation and a modest tan head.Smell - Pancakes were immediately brought to mind with notes of coffee and maples syrup in the nose. It was like breakfast for dinner.Taste - As with the nose, it was like breakfast for dinner. The maple syrup seemed to saturate the stout, permeating the body. The beer was not overly sweet, but was balanced by the coffee notes. It seemed as though the coffee was washing down the sweetness. Notes of semi-sweet chocolate same toward the back, but the overall profile of chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup lingered.Mouthfeel - The body was thick, but not quite motor oil quality. This made the beer more drinkable than the average heavy stout. Carbonation was still very present.Overall - The beer was definitely hype worth. Unlike some other TG beers, it was relatively easy to obtain.",4.25
Mornin' Delight,"2022 Variant - bottle split 4 ways - pours a a rich black with a nice mocha foam into a tulip. Overpowering maple on the nose, and was a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me, and too much of a dessert stout, but the taste was so well balanced - maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and baker's chocolate flavor.While MD was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective, this was not a cheap bottle to get to Pittsburgh haha - overall - well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given it's more readily available, it's still a world class pour. Glad I have a bottle left.",4.95

King Julius,Excellent,4.5
King Julius,"A - Pours a hazy orange with a one finger creamy white head. Heavy amount of soapy lacing.S - Aroma is orange, mango and pineapple.T - The taste follows the aroma with orange juice, pineapple, mango, cantaloupe and a light bitterness in the finish.M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finish.O - This is a top notch NEIPA.",4.42
King Julius,"L: A Yellow Gold which poured with two fingers of white head. Extremely hazy.S: Pineapple, some mango, orange zest.T: Follows nose with a bit less pineapple. A little bitterness on the back end.F: Moderate carbonation, medium to full body.O: An absolute masterpiece. No wonder it's rated so highly.",5
King Julius,"Pours a dark orange, totally opaque. Small head that disappears quickly but with good lacing. Nose is faint mangos, taste is a soft mango and peach with some bitterness. I liked this better than fresh Julius. A good hazy, better than most but not so amazing you should drive 400 miles. I enjoyed Tree House, but its annoying you have to pay for full pours and can't pay to try several things and see what you like.",4.67
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"2021 batch 3, drank in June 2022. Didn't get as much from this as previous ADWTD. Felt sweet without complexity that you would expect. Still very delicious, just not worth the price.",4.63
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"Complex and boozy, hits all the right barley wine notes but adds so much more. Fruity, sweet but not cloying. Thick but not too heavy, just all around outstanding.",5
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"My first sacrifice at Dark Lord Day 2023 (it's back baby!!!), this screenprinted batch 1 Triple Oak label--sporting those the Aussie stickers with pride--poured a mildly viscous clear reddish-copper with nary a head to speak of, though ringed by a bubbly tan chain.Intensely woody up front, it even leans a little pungent and catty right out of the bottle. However, it quickly transforms into an explodingly delectable maple tempered by a whiskey heat that both continue to expand on the exhale and with each subsequent sip.Though this definitely shows its age, it's quite the experience nevertheless. Still, I'm not sure anything can beat my nostalgia for the original cognac-only bomber, despite my Double Oak rating being the highest of all three.",4.28
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,As good as it gets. From the bottle at Rosada Ranch on 04/02/23.,4.9
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"This is a special one. I wanted to crack this while reading Brandon Sanderson's ""Tress Of The Emerald Sea"". So I did.Apppearance is dark brown, just a shade brighter than a cup of coffee. Definitely some translucence.Nose is just a cacophony of oak, bourbon, dark bread with plum jam, apple butter, caramel soaked raisins, and coconut. Wow. Simply exquisite. The nose is expressive, but not overbearing. Restrained.The taste follows the nose perfectly. Sweet, dark fruit, like plum, date and fig, combined with caramel and brown sugar, rich breadiness, oak, apple, cherry, baking spices. Everything works perfectly with each other.Mouthfeel is full bodied. Not thick or syrupy either. Not too cloying. A little bit of evaporation to counteract. Some tannins to dry. It fits well in this regard. It doesn't hang too heavy on the palate.Overall this is stellar brew. I can't think of many words to really capture how absolutely amazing this experience is. A product crafted by masters in thier field and it shines through brilliantly.",4.99
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"2022 vintageReview 1600! I've saved a truly legendary beer for this milestone review, the highest rated American Barleywine on BA and 13th highest rated overall. I just had the Double Oak version yesterday and it was damn good, so I have high hopes for this. Let's crack this beast open and see what it's all aboutPours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a nothing and leaves no lacing, but with fantastic legsIn the nose, it's also quite similar to Double Oak, though with some more barrel presence. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy bourbon, charred oak, molasses, burnt caramel, plum, black cherry, cognac, toasted coconut, sweet vanilla, old leather, light fig, and toffeeThe booze is more forward here, but it pushes such wonderful complexities in taste that it actually adds to the experience. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting cocoa powder, black cherry, cognac, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, honey, molasses, dark toast, fig, sweet vanilla, raisin, light toffee, and tobacco. The swallow brings notes of leather, smoky tobacco, charred oak, molasses, fig, black cherry, toasted coconut, port wine, plum, cacao nib, burnt caramel, brown sugar, and light walnutA full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a rich and silky beer. Finishes a tad sticky, but the boozy tingle dries it out over timeThis is incredible. The Double Oak version was great too, but this one edges it out. Definitely a beer I'll remember for years to come",5

King JJJuliusss,"What's left to say about the best of the best of the NEIPA style? I don't know, but it pours an absolutely gorgeous opaque, turbid, chewy looking beast. Aromas and flavors burst with never-too-bitter juices. Ridiculously smooth, pillowy mouthfeel and soft, easy finish. Just incredible.",4.5
King JJJuliusss,"Poured from a can into a snifterAppearance- The beer pours a super hazy orange-juice color with a massive puffy white head. The head has a great level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving spiderweb lacing all over the sides of the glass.Smell – The aroma is huge of an orange rind smell mixed with sweet notes of tangerine and orange as well as plenty of herbal hops and a strong showing of pine and earth. Mixed with thee smells are some juicy pineapple, mango, and papaya with some citrus hop smell with a ruby red grapefruit. Other citrus notes of lemon and lime as well as some bready malt and light grain are there as well, mixing in with some raw hop smells to produce a rather dank and green hoppy smell overall. mTaste – The taste begins with a thick bready malt flavor that is composed mostly of a smooth wheat, doughy, and oaty flavor. There is also a moderately sizable fruit flavor upfront, with orange and peach being the strongest, but with notes of pear and apple and a hint of lemon in there as well. The hop is strong from the start as well, with a earthy and herbal hop being the most pronounced followed by some notes of pine and floral hops. As the taste advances the pine and herb grown stronger while the earth fades, bringing more dankness to the tongue. That said the sweetness picks up a tad, balancing out the hops rather well, and with some very raw hop and grassy flavors coming on at the end, one is left with a dank, but sweeter and malty taste to linger on the tongue.Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate to higher carbonation level. Quite nice for the thick and dank tastes of the brew and certainly makes for a nice slow sipper.Overall –A quite nice and tasty brew with a lot of hop attitude, but a balanced demeaner. While not quite up to the hype, it is certainly a well crafted brew.",4.71

Zenne Y Frontera,18/19 blend 93.,4.79
Zenne Y Frontera,"Blend n94 Season 18/19. Drank 02.02.23 out of a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.Look - No head and little carb, gold color.Smell - Distinctly lambic.Taste - Acid. Too much at cellar temp, but when it got to room temp, it was more tasty, but still too much on the sour side for my taste.Feel - Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation.Overall - Just too sour and acidly of a lambic for me to really enjoy; I need to give another blend another shot just to see if it was this batch, or if Zenne might not be my thing.",4.75
Zenne Y Frontera,"A: Pours crystal clear, dark golden yellow, almost amber, small fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. 4.25S: Aroma is tart lactic acidity, a big minerality, some plastic like funk notes, only the faintest barnyard characters. Mild sherry notes give it a subtle fruitiness. A bit of spice on the finish like white pepper. 4.75T: Taste is immediately wildly complex. There’s a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch, then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever. It’s not as aggressively tart as some lambics/gueuzes, likely subdued by the cask asking. Other characters I get are red grapes, tart citrus, moderate spice. Just fantastic, so much going on, and the finish is divine. 5M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Carbonation lower than most in the style but insanely drinkable. 4.25O: A gem of a beer. Well worth the hype. An elite beer. 4.75",4.56

Pliny The Younger,"I've been chasing this beer for the better part of 13 years. Today was finally the day. 500ml capped bottle into a Fuzzy IPA glass.Pours crystal clear goldenrod with a slowly building 2 finger foamy white head that sits around. Patchy, stringy lace sticks to the inside of the glass. Nose is citrus, pine, grass, and sap. Fresh, aggressive, resiny. Very pungent. Beer opens grass, pine, and citrus. Zesty towards the middle with loads of fresh pine, unripened tropical fruit, and tree sap. Finishes with a crystal clean bitterness that is dry and lingers in the aftertaste. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate, and goes down dry with a lingering, sticky aftertaste.I may be buying into the hype a bit after all this time but in a category that everyone in the world tries to do 10 times over, this is somehow the best of the bunch. A near perfect beer in every way. This juice is worth the squeeze.",4.71

Having been blessed with national travel for work and fly fishing trips - and the expendable budget to have had the opportunity to try many of the top beers on beer advocate and those celebrated by fellow beer lovers. I’ve had many many IPAs from Vermont to Colorado and New York to California - but my brother and his gang of beer connoisseurs demanded that I join them in Boulder Colorado for the tapping of a 2023 Pliny the Younger at the annual celebration at Backcountry Pizza & Taphouse… and I couldn’t be more delighted that they did - might be best beer that have ever crossed this unrefined pallet. Perfect all around and holy shit drinkable …,4.94
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,I kinda wish there was more toasted coconut and less young coconut in this bad boy.,4.72
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,"Look - outstanding black thick with a really nice than frothy sticky headSmell - so much coconut and chocolateTaste - sweet coconut and chocolate along with a ton of barrelFeel - thick and creamyOverall - if you like coconut, this is the best there is",4.9
Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,"Thick, gooey, delicious. Just tastes magnificent. Great smell. Amazing body. Coats the mouth perfectly. One of the best I've ever had. Nice and dark, not boozy, super sweet.",5
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,My bottle was heavily infected. 2022. Anyone else have this happen?,4.36
Fundamental Observation,"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is a wonderful combination of rich chocolate, deep vanilla with hints of bourbon and dark fruits. Taste is really intense combination following nose -- dark chocolate, strong vanilla, fruity and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall incredible stout.",5
Fundamental Observation,"2022 vintage (batch 8) served in my Bruery snifter. Pours one shade shy of black. Complexion is opaque. Head ins loose and mocha-colored and quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders and an oily slick across the surface. Nose is decadent vanilla, caramel, cocoa and spirits. This is going to be decadently sweet! Taste follows nose - spirits are subdued and only come out at the finish. The rest is just pure candy. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a semi-still carbonation. Overall, an amazing imperial stout.",4.25
Fundamental Observation,"500ml capped bottle into a BBT snifter.Pours with a 1 finger dark mocha head. Beer pours heavy, pitch black, viscous. Sticky, mocha legs. Nose is chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and barrel. Pungent and rich. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and fudge. Hints of cocoa powder and roasted malt. Big barrel overtones. More vanilla and molasses in the finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Sticky and viscous on the palate and goes down warm with a long, lingering, sticky aftertaste.This is great. Simple but well made. Amazing body.",4.86
Fundamental Observation,One of my favorites from BL... I only had B1 a few years ago but Im catching up on my reviews.,4.5
Fundamental Observation,"Received from a generous person in a NBS BIF back in 2020 and split with a friend soon thereafter. This is from the notes.Pours the color of strong coffee (""Stout Black"" I like to call it) and is light blocking dark in the glass with just a little walnut hue on the edges. The deep brown head is inviting and slow to dissipate.The aroma gave me vanilla first, bourbon second, and the menagerie of dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, wood, char that make up the malts contribution to the smells. Very nice, if a little more vanilla than expected.The taste was solid. The vanilla, so heavily featured in the aroma, was first on the tongue, followed and overwhelmed my the coffee-chocolate-dark fruits almost cake like in effect; not sweet exactly, just decadent (if that makes any sense) The bourbon was in the swallow, terminating the pastry party effectively.The feel was a viscous pleasure. For such an ABV I like something with heft, or body - to sip and savor, not quaff down like some AAL. This nicely fits my preferences almost perfectly.Would love to try again, but glad I got to try it at least once.",4.6
Fundamental Observation,"Received from the ever-generous @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022, and drunk in May 2023.L: Thick, jet black. Utterly still. There's a thin coat of rusty, coppered-coloured foam atop the glass.S: Umami roastiness, booze, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, and ethereal spirit notes from the bourbon. Surprisingly, this didn't change much as the beer warmed.T: Vanilla and bourbon notes dominate the initial swallow, and then a wave of booze crashes over the top, burning throat, tongue and larynx like a good RIS should. There's a tangy hit of malt and then a retronasal whack of cookie dough settles in and lingers long. Warmth settles in the stomach and a medicinal sweetness slides in after the cookie dough fades. There's an excellent balance to this beer - there's no danger of cloying sweetness, nor is there so much stickiness that wasps begin to hover expectantly around my head.M: Mouthfeel is thick and unctuous - there's minimal carbonation but it suits the beer well. As noted above there's warmth seeping lazily through my body at the halfway mark of this one, and it settles deep and comfortably, like an old, familiar couch.O: This is an enjoyable but intense beer experience. There's no likelihood of a second beer after you've spent an hour or so in the company of this beer, but the size of this beer means that's not a problem.Cheers!#242",4.25
Fundamental Observation,"A real sweet treat. It’s like a piece of Portillo’s chocolate cake soaked in some tasty bourbon and then poured into a glass. Plenty of vanilla presence too. Full bodied, big, bold, boozy, and in no way overly thick, oily, or cloying. A nice slow sipper, because it really improves and opens up as it sits in the glass for a few hours.",4.39
Fundamental Observation,"Previous review somehow deleted, but from memory hit notes reminiscent of other chocolate-heavy. fudgey, and dense stouts. Vanilla wasn't too prominent, while mouthfeel had some light carbonation and was surprisingly moderate.",4.37
Fundamental Observation,"Appearance: Fundamental Observation has a deep, dark brown color with a creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly. The beer is opaque and has good clarity.Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruit (figs, raisins), and a hint of smokiness. There is also a distinct hop character that adds to the overall aroma profile.Taste: The flavor is full-bodied and robust with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. The dark chocolate and coffee notes are prominent, with hints of dark fruit, toasted nuts, and smokiness. The hop character adds a pleasant bitterness to the finish.Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a moderate carbonation that adds a nice effervescence. The beer is full-bodied and has a long finish that lingers on the tongue.Overall impressions: Fundamental Observation is a well-crafted, complex beer with a rich flavor profile. The aroma and taste are well-balanced, and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This beer is a great choice for those who enjoy dark, rich, and full-bodied stouts.",4.46
Fundamental Observation,"I had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage. This review is for the 2019 vintage. The 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory), although I think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker.Surprisingly, at 3 years this beer hasn't lost much (any?) vanilla, although refrigerated most of that time.The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell. The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else. Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract. The taste is similar, but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for. It's the essence, but not direct flavor. Lots of deep, fudgy chocolate. A bit of alcohol on the back end, which is unusual, but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla. While tasty, I wouldn't say that the taste is complex.Nothing exceptional about this beer, but it is very good. I think that my score accurately reflects how I feel about this beer and what I think it is deserving of.",4.53
Very Hazy,"Quite certain I've had this one before, but apparently never reviewed. Yeah, it's decent! I lack the flair with my superlatives these days to detail the nuances. If you can get your hands on this one, do so.",4.75
Very Hazy,"Pours like opaque guava juice with a 2 finger creamy off-white head that faded extremely slowly and left really nice lacing on the glass. It smells like tangerine, orange juice, papaya, tropical fruit, dank citrus hops, faint biscuit, a hint of caramel and some flowery spices as it fades. The flavor was very similar to the nose with tangerine, orange juice, papaya, tropical fruit, and the additions of peaches, lemon zest and citrus hops that have off the dry hopped vibe. More malty backbone in the taste with sweet grains, biscuit, chalky yeast, graham cracker and then spices like coriander or white pepper in the finish. The bitterness level was perfect and the taste completely hid the ABV, this indeed was very hazy and very tasty overall.",4.27
Very Hazy,4/30/23 Canned 4/19/22. What more could you ask for in a NEIPA? As good as any I’ve had. As advertised.,4.4
Very Hazy,"Pours like straight up juice with one finger of eggshell colored head.S: Citrus & tropical fruits, nose could've been better. Nice head retention & lacingT: Grapefruit, Kiwi Fruit, grassiness, pineapple & dryness up front. Lime, peaches, oranges & pineapple as this beer warms up, acidic notes from the pineapple, some grassy notes as well. Finishes with pineapple & orange, plus limesMF: Medium body, fairly restrained carbonation, carbonation goes creamy as this warms up; nice balanceVery nice take on the style just got better as this warmed up. If everything else was equal to the flavor, I would rated this higher",4.35
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"16.9oz bottled best by 9-7-24, opened 9-10-23.Thin tan head with limited staying power, falls to a ring and island quickly and hangs there. Opaque body at the core with dark brown at the edge. No lace.Rich, roasty malt aroma with dark fruit, earthy coffee, wet wood, and spice.Lots of fruit flavors, unclear if it's a by-product of the coffee or yeast, malt, booze, or some other component. Coffee shows best after 30 minutes or so of warming up. Booze is present but almost an afterthought amidst the cacaphony of fruit and coffee flavors.Medium plus body with some prickly heat. Smoother mouthfeel as it warms. Lengthy, flavorful finish with a bit of sweetness.Very Good.",4.73
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Pours a dark opaque brown- black with a small brown head. The aroma is coffee, Bourbon, and roasty malts. Flavor is dark fruits, brown sugar, roasted malt, and coffee. Medium- full bodied and a little acidic. Finishes clean with a little tingling on the tongue, either from the pH or the alcohol. Very good. Easy drinking.",4.75
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Aroma is bourbon, coffee, chocolate, dark malts and slightly earthy. The flavor is fruit/dark fruit, chocolate, mild coffee and an acidic dark malt/warming bourbon alcohol finish.",4.6
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"This is the 2022 vintage with Burundian Turihamwe coffee blend from Intelligentsia. Poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.Look: The beer is a pure opaque black with no light coming through. Topped with a creamy finger thick head with OK retention. This is a real imperial looking stout.Smell: Creamy aroma of mocha and fresh espresso. Deep chocolate notes throughout. Not as much bourbon as in the original variant on first glance, which may be a good thing. This is inviting. Dark fruits somewhere within. As the beer warms, more of the bourbon and woody noes come out a bit. Vanilla makes an appearance as well as this warms, and a slight spice.Taste: Chocolatey up front with notes of mocha in between roasted and toasted malt. Some vanilla quickly covered up by bourbon, which is immediately more evident than in the aroma. Brown sugar, creme caramel. Surprising that this beer retains a sweeter than expected character throughout. Finishes with just as touch of bourbon underneath a really smooth, almost fruity and spicy coffee note. Again not as heavy handed with the bourbon, which is definitely there, but much more nuanced.Feel: Creamy with light carbonation. Coating. Finishes smooth with just a hint of tingling alcohol at the very end.Overall: Oh yeah, this is a good one. I love that it doesn't try to hammer you over the head with the bourbon flavor. Instead it slowly brings you in with a wide variety of flavors. The spotlight here is the Turihamwe coffee blend, which really makes a difference in the flavor profile that shows in the end product. A premium product for sure, but it lives up to expectations, revealing something new at every sip. A special experience that will probably show up in my top 10.",4.34
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2022 vintage:Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a snifter.Look- Black, medium brown frothy head, plentiful visible particulate at margins, average head retention and lacing.Smell- Coffee, cacao, bourbon, oak, cherry, high strength of scent.Taste- Bourbon, coffee, cacao, oak, high strength of flavor.Feel- Between medium and full bodied, moderately mouth coating, average carbonation, highly mouth warming, high bitterness, smooth.Overall- Black with plentiful visible particulate at the margins. Strong bouquet of coffee, cacao and bourbon. Vibrant flavors of bourbon, coffee, cacao and oak. Body was between medium and full with high mouth warming properties. Dynamic flavors and bouquet made for a fantastic drinking experience!",4.42

V.S.O.J.,"Canned 6/29/21Now this is a special one, the highest rated English Barleywine on BA, VSOJ! A long time want of mine, I wanted to try it while I have the Double Barrel VSOJ on the way thanks to Tavour. I’ve had the OG Straight Jacket and some variants before, but this is by far the most exciting. Let’s get into itPours an opaque dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacingThe nose brings an intense wave of sweetness, but it’s balanced out by spicier notes. I’m picking up on aromas of burnt caramel, sweet whiskey, molasses, rye bread, golden raisin, brown sugar, charred oak, old leather, fig, tobacco, and sweet toffeeWow, everything in taste is kicked up a notch, boozy and fruity but not overly sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting fig, sweet toffee, burnt caramel, black cherry, molasses, dry oak, vanilla, earthy whiskey, and light brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of sweet whiskey, charred oak, molasses, rye bread, tobacco, raisin, brown sugar, burnt caramel, vanilla, old leather, and light toffeeA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky and boozy, yet still drinks well below the listed 15%Oh yeah, this is one hell of a beer. As expected from Revolution, it’s so much thinner in execution in relation to the flavor. I can’t wait to try the Double Barrel VSOJ next",4.54
V.S.O.J.,"Oh damn this absolutely lives up to its reputation. Nothing unfamiliar in a barleywine here but there is a lot going on and everything is so BIG. 2-4 years in barrels adds such a layer of... profundity to the already stellar Straight Jacket. I feel underdressed, semi-literate, and unwashed sipping on this.Raisins, molasses, high end whiskey, and leather dominate. There is a lot more at the edges though, candied nuts, honey, pipe tobacco, and a hell of a lot more. Such enveloping, deep warmth but not at all hot. People with access to Revolution are lucky indeed. Thanks so much FBarber!",4.75
V.S.O.J.,"12oz can at share. Dark brown pour with a foamy beige head. Aroma is malty, toffee, prunes, , hint of vanilla. Taste is malty, leathery, sweet, caramel, light chocolate, pit fruit. Smooth and strong. Aroma of malt, chocolate, caramel, vanilla and bourbon. Malty and caramelly flavor with chocolate and raisin leading into a vanilla and bourbon finish. Had side by side with Straight Jacket and this one definitely smelled and tasted more chocolatey and caramelly; more decadent. World class BW.",4.71
V.S.O.J.,"Pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected. I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait. Truly a world class English barleywine.",4.6
Oude Fermier,"2020 vintage. Mostly clear yellow pour with a fat finger of eggshell white foam, spotted lacing. I went in skeptical here, but actually I must admit this is top shelf! Smell capture a myriad of oak nuances catching fruit: peach, orange, lime, white grape, and green apple as the most defined, add a hint of dandelion and must to round out. Taste takes it a step further: honestly SP's best non-fruit wild saison, if not their best saison period. Add passion fruit, pear, and a whisper of grapefruit to the fruit from the nose, oak is now toasty and bright, vinous kiss adds layers in a gentle way, floral tones are more generic compared to nose though, must and funk elevate. Feel is bright, sour, sneaky funky, oak backing is refined, and dries out well through the sip with controlled acidity dotting the palate, very dialed in.",4.71
Oude Fermier,"An enjoyable saison. 2020 Vintage, enjoyed in a tulip at a Creve Coeur, MO Courtyard. Dry oak, white wine, appropriate level of funk, but refreshing with citrus notes and the right level of sour. I've heard that this vintage wasn't as good, so definitely didn't live up to the hype, but I still found it fairly enjoyable.",5
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak-Aged Barleywine is an extraordinary beer that left a lasting impression on my taste buds. The combination of its rich double oak aging and complex flavors creates a truly remarkable experience. The aroma greets you with notes of caramel, vanilla, and subtle hints of bourbon, setting the stage for what’s to come.The taste is where this beer truly shines. The double oak aging process imparts a smoothness that is both velvety and warming. It boasts a perfect balance of malty sweetness, dark fruit flavors, and a delicate touch of oak and bourbon. As it warms up, the complexities further unfold, revealing layers of complexity that keep you intrigued throughout each sip.The mouthfeel is luxurious and full-bodied, showcasing the craftsmanship behind this beer. The finish is long-lasting, leaving a pleasant aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip.While this is certainly not an everyday beer due to its higher ABV, it is undeniably a treat worth savoring on special occasions or for those seeking an indulgent experience. Its bold flavors and well-crafted profile make it a standout among barrel-aged beers.Whether you’re an avid beer enthusiast or simply looking to try something exceptional, Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak is undoubtedly a top-tier choice that I highly recommend. Cheers!",4.93

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"*Batch 5*Pours the deepest of dark browns, no head. Bourbon and leather on the nose masking some almond and perhaps also some dried fruit. My partner says Twizzlers, and I can see that too. Under the omnipresence of bourbon, I get raisin, brown sugar, then cola and fig on the finish. This is good albeit a little sweet, which does make it hard to get to completion, if you are drinking this on its own, which if you spent a lot of money on the bottle, you are probably feeling this way. Anyway, it's a good beer and barleywine. I think the barrel character, the oak, could've been more rugged, but it has plenty of boozy character.",4.66
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"Pours a rich mahogany with red edges. Head is reluctant, but slowly emerges with tight tan bubbles, almost like it’s nitro’d.Quiet nose, still dominated by alcohol heat, even after 6 years of aging. Pull your nose back from the glass, and you’re met with subtle vanilla, coconut and stewed dark fruits.Flavors are massive, and immediately hit you with boozy, oaky, tannic cognac bite. It evolves into dark caramel, toffee, bitter pecan, figs and vanilla. Just a huge barrel influence, with flawless blending to keep things in balanced. Sweetness is perfectly in check, and you’d never know it’s 17%.Mouthfeel is impossibly smooth with absolutely no alcohol burn. It’s perfect.Perfect birthday beer. Exactly the type of thing I love. Huge barrel character, tempered sweetness, tons of oaky vanilla. This beer laughs at 6 years of aging.. it could last 60.",4.68
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"2022 vintageI've finally arrived at the illustrious A Deal With The Devil series. I have not had the base beer, but I recently came across this and the Triple Oak-Aged version. Considering this is review #1599 for me, I wonder what I'll choose for the milestone review #1600...Let's get into itPours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing, but with fantastic legsThe nose here is very sweet, but in no way overbearing, with much of the sweetness coming from dark fruit notes. I’m picking up on aromas of fig, dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, vanilla, black cherry, burnt caramel, charred oak, cognac, molasses, light port wine, and toasted walnutIt keeps up the sweetness and the balance of said sweetness in taste despite some seriously boozy notes that come through, and somehow improves upon it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, sweet bourbon, brown sugar, raisin, toasted oak, vanilla, smoky tobacco, sticky caramel, light coconut, plum, and a touch of port wine. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, plum, port wine, burnt caramel, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, charred oak, earthy bourbon, walnut, and the slightest hint of fusel alcoholA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry and seriously complex, and the booze actually works really well here for a perfect mouthfeelThis is awesome. I'm not sure it's worth what it sells for, but who cares? It was great to get to try this nonetheless. With the second highest rated American Barleywine behind me, we all know what's next",4.41
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"This was supposed to be a legendary Barley wine. It was also a very expensive barley wine. Maybe my palate is not developed enough to tell the difference between this and other BA barley wine's.Look: Typical caramel colorSmell: Toffee, dark fruitTaste: Follows he noseFeel: medium bodyOverall: I gave it an overall rating of 4 due to the price. I just can't justify $100 for a 12 ounce bottle. One and done for me, not worth the price.",4.67
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"Sweet caramel/molasses/toffee bits, hint of dark fruity raisins, and a balanced bourbon barrel boozy nose on this one! Nice aromatics here! Taste follows with a dark fruity, caramel malty, and bourbon barrel swallow. Nose>Taste IMO and, although this is delicious, either there is just a hint of age is showing on the backend or other breweries are catching up to the high standard that Anchorage has set with barleywines. Good Stuff!",4.72
Clover,"375ml waxed and capped bottle into Torst stemware.Pours a bright goldenrod color. 0.5 finger foamy white head. Little lace with thin legs. Nose is juicy pear, lemon zest, peppercorn, and a spritz and funky barnyard. Moderately aromatic. Beer opens lemon zest, apricot pit, with a slight touch of butter in the back. Funky towards the middle. Hints of bread, yeast, and peppercorn. Tart lemon seed in the finish. Lightly puckering aftertaste. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and goes down zesty, dry, with a long, lingering aftertaste.Great complexity though I wish I'd continued to wait a bit before opening this.",5
Clover,"Batch 3 bottle poured onsite at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT.This one pours a clear golden yellow-ish orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing.This smells like a sort of rustic oak thing, lemon peel, stone fruit, white wine, candied orange, and a dry hay like quality.This is a blend of Flora, Art, and Ann, so it’s not surprising at all that this is really good. Having had all of those at this point, I wouldn’t say any one beer entirely stands out – this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own, and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed. It’s very oaky, and orange-like, with a hay-like dry finish that is just so refreshing. There’s also stone fruit, white wine, dried lemon peel, with a restrained and very pleasant acidity.This is light bodied, clean, lightly and pleasantly tart, and super drinkable.This is absolutely fantastic, and might just crack the top 5 of Hill Farmstead beers that I’ve had – it’s just such a good and clearly deliberate blend.",4.75
Clover,"Bottle. 2020 edition. At HF brewery.White head with some lace. Clear golden color.Such an excellent saison. Definitely has flavors of the base beers. Elegant is a great word for this beer. Drinks like a white wine maybe a Chardonnay. White grapes, oak, green apples, faint saison spice, wheat. Dry and bubbly. Smooth, light, easy drinking. Faint tartness, nice citrus.",4.5
Clover,"Had at a Mortalis share. Definitely one of those taste the country yellow beers. Tart, crisp, light. Not my style, but come on now…these bottles shares are amazeballs. Lots of oak dryness.",5
Clover,"Had b2 and b3 side by side. This rating is for b2, which was better in just about every category than b3. B3 wasnt bad by any means, but b2 was an amazing farmhouse ale /saison",5
Clover,"Clear yellow-gold with minimal head formation dying to a clear, bubbly and uneven surface that disperses to a bubbly flat collar. The appearance was impressively identical between two different batches, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy in one evening.Starting with batch 2, the oak is very expressive, yet gentle at the same time, backed by reduced citrus juice characteristics like grapefruit, orange and lemon. This was a smaller pour than I had of batch 3, but the contrasts were stark, while the more obscure parallels somehow held firm.Out of batch 3, I perceive a larger presence of straw and young oak up front, but this quickly gives way to more acid than b2, while yet remaining palatably balanced. This acidity expresses like yellow raspberry and seedy passion fruit, countered by a frothy body that exhales refined oak threads. While that Ann oak in conjunction with the subtle funk of Art solidly affirm their support, it was clear that Flora's return to the blend saw her influence well exerted here.This has been a very long time coming for me, and contrary to most experiences with meeting your idols, this did not let me down. I came away preferring b3, though absent of overwhelming confidence, as they were both phenomenal in different ways.",4.24
Clover,"Bottle Conditioning since December 23, 2020. So, I believe batch 3.Lemon & lime with soft oak & light earth. Vinous white wine notes. Lower carbonation.",4.84
Anabasis,"750ml waxed and capped bottle into a Side Project snifter.Pours rich, muddy, and dense. No head, no lace, huge, oily, chunky legs. Nose is booze, raisin, anise, brown sugar, sweet soy sauce, and plum. Very aromatic. Beer opens dried purple fruit. Notes of prunes, sweet soy sauce, anise, and raisin. Layers of brown sugar, molasses in the middle. Bone dry and boozy at the end. Syrup, tobacco, oak, and almost a salty molasses in the aftertaste. Fantastic complexity. Body is full with low carbonation. Thick, oily, and chewy on the palate. Boozy, bone dry finish with a sticky aftertaste.Very solid. Great complexity.",4.81
Anabasis,"Appearance - the beer was almost black in appearance with some variation in color and little carbonation.Smell - The nose was composed of the barrel and dark fruits. It lean toward the sweet side.Taste - The bourbon barrel was strong with this one, but not hot. Notes of port, fruit, leather, tobacco, cherries, and oak were present. Needless to say, it was a diverse pallet. The port and oak notes really stood out. This was a sipper.Mouthfeel - The body was not overly thick, especially when judged to today’s outrageous standards. Carbonation was muted.Overall - This is an elite barleywine.",4.51
Anabasis,"Blend #5. Thanks to Luscious_Malfoy for hooking me up with this bottle! So the appearance is not a looker: sludgy brown body, no head, but the rest of this beer is breathtaking. Big rich and complex rustic bourbon barrel, barley, toasted caramel, tons of dark fruit, rye, molasses, char, black licorice, vanillins, and leather nose. Taste is similar: adds slight anise no licorice and char though, oxidized sugars with attached earthiness, vanillins emerge over time more. Feel is thick and warm with great barrel character, barley splashes on the palate in such a smooth way, luxurious and complex, though heavy. Met the hype!",4.68
Anabasis,Blend 5 poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip. Perfectly sweet. Nicely thick. This ranks up their with some of the best Revolution BW in my opinion.,4.79
Anabasis,"A: A zinnwaldite brown discharge to the carafe with a Fisher Cat disguise, as the highlights near a Ruddy Duck tint. The stabilizing agents on the collar lack the hydrophobic polypeptides to substantiate; nonetheless, they are attuned to the design through brevity. As such, an output that has a Cassava toned neck, and a Roman Mushroom hued rim. The latticework suffers from the negative – appropriate – materials, but there’s a residue leeway using gentle agitation. This necessities at the launch, which is hastily cut inside the minute(s), as a new nuance defines the drippy – cathedral – windowsS: The blend plays to the barrels with an accompany netting over the malts, while thickly layering esters atop hop sanities. Chiefly, a presence on acetates that pushes a solvent characteristic above the finer points, as they struggle – against epoxy – at the outset. Nonetheless, an oak derivative that midriffs on furfurals, which benefit the grain bill, by advancing the sweet caramel notations around Colomba di Pasqua. The road has a Rabitos Royale cusp with a cherry cordial prompt, as sultanas devise Boerenjongens. Moreover, a chord on orange blossom honey, which pursues a robust earthiness, while transmitting coniferous woodlands. This simulates treks covering Douglas Fir & Scots Pine trees, while natural Copal resins air above. Subsequently, a balmy increment to the hour, for attuning burnt sugar toffee to the skins of grapes, as the schedule concatenates on ethyl hexanoates. Namely, aniseed upon sundried apples, while the cask to malt ratio encompasses an oak plank grit on Moravian Wafers. The ventilation across the clocked periods delivers caved Moscatel congruities, which meld Raisin Marmalatas into eucalyptus shrubs. In due course, a @ > 80°F that sticks an aridness on guaiacols over beeswax, while a meerschaum presence stains vintage – vinylon – coatsT: An isoamyl octanoate shadow to the deeply drawn hemicelluloses, where the oak structures pitch lipid derivatives. There is a solvent continuation, which is calmer than the odors let on, yet a paint to wood varnish – remnant – remains over the initial records. The direction incorporates Daim bars to German nougat sweets, as Vínartertas concoct. Underneath, a drawing on teakwood, by a deciduous nature, beyond vanilla agroforests. Secondly, a recognition – of the diastatic enzyme conversions – that benefits the malt saccharifications over maple crème caramels, while drawing on Peruvian coffees. There is an earthy hop poise to the residual sweetness, which lends a woodsy bite to the course. In doing so, the blend advances without choking, and furthers the development behind acetates, as tied to the cask enhancements. A development that’s constantly subjected to the °F upticks, as open air addresses the carafe, for an oxidized maturity outside the porous wood doings. In this situation, the process provokes vintage Armagnacs, where peculiar leathers top candid fruits, besides dated mink boots against flue-cured tobacco. A continuation that hints at shabby – masonry – chimneys, while phenolic compounds deliver eugenols over the charred lactone sentientsM: A texture that delineates a sharp bite across barbed resins, which imbalances the kick-off. Coupled with, tannin constitutions, for elevating (& refining) dry executions against a soft glutinousness. As such, a dexterity with a sensitive viscosity through a warming decree, yet careful on the inebriant malaises, as carbonation brings a soft effervescence. The output lends a harmonic bitterness with a greenery balance, by the phased hop pillarsO: Emphasizes the 26mths to 19mths with a warm barrel perceptiveness, which is slightly furthered outside the necessary transfers, considering a start that battles to make inroads. A blend that has a robust grain bill, where temperaments platform in steps, as reconciliations take place on the divergences",4.56

Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,"Putting a little pep in your step and numbing the senses all at once, 3 Floyd's pink peppercorn and cinnamon Dark Lord variant takes this Imperial Stout to the nuclear level.... and with snacks.Jet black and pouring like ink, Chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong, savory and sultry blend of coffee, cocoa, whisky, spice, port wine and sherry. As the inky elixir hits the tongue, the taste is enlivened with the sweetness of brown sugar, blackstrap molasses, toffee, honey and caramel with hints of chocolate and condensed fruit.As the stout extends across the middle palate, the sweetness slowly turns to dry. A rise of espresso, baker's chocolate, roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle. Trending warm with rye whisky and oak, the late palate trends coconut-like with vanilla, earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities.Full bodied, pleasantly chewy and off-cloying, Chemtrailmix finishes malty-dry, spicy and very warm. With impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste, this calls for a long, patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice.",4.59

There’s also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note.The barrel is more pronounced on the taste, and a perfect, spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor - and the still bigly cinnamon, which is delicious. There’s also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit. There’s a LOT going on here and it’s all magnificent, IMHO.The mouthfeel is velvety and coats the mouth properly, commensurate with a beer of this magnitude.

Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,"#172, fantastic!",4.75
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,"Phenomenal. Poured cold to a Glencairn glass. Dark burnt caramel color, minimal fuse-fast head. Aroma is unexpectedly heavy prune with a base of leather and light vanilla. First sips are laden with bourbon bite, I mean a heavy hit of hot but enjoyably sweet spirit. The barrel wood is forward, bringing images of saturated staves oozing booze and tannins. I don’t even know the ABV but it’s easy to kick back a big swig…though I only have this one lonely can to enjoy. Mouthfeel is full, with a nice stickiness. The caramel bites are all over the middle and end flavors. It carries traits similar to a stout/barleywine cuvée, like Anchorage’s Endless Endings, wherein there is a dark malt middle flavor once the sip is gone and you’re enjoying the linger. I also find it similar to Fremont’s B6K, but with a much more subdued and harmonious sweetness profile. Next time, I’ll try to get a 4-pack. I had a meeting that day…in hindsight, it was with an asshole, so my time would have been better spent ordering beer online.",4.67

Julius,"Poured from a can into a teku glassAppearance – The beer pours a very hazy orange color with a big puffy head of off-white foam. THE head has a great level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.Smell -The aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature. There are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within. Notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well, giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall.Taste – The taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose. It begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop. Notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well, but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop. All the hop flavors are rather “raw” in nature, having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them. These potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste. While said, there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine, peach, and apricot, as well as a hint of mango. The mix of sweet, bready and hop take the taste to its end, where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue.Mouthfeel – The body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side. For the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper.Overall – A very nice brew overall. I think I like this better than the King Julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint, but hits all the same high notes as the king variety. Big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop, malt, and fruit.",4.73

Lovely nose of pineapple, mango and assorted citrus... Some light wheat notes linger beneath the surface... Hop presence is more floral and less citrus and reminds me of whole cone fresh hops... Some lemon zest notes as well... Feel is light to medium bodied and a touch thin... Carbonation is minimal... Highly quaffable... Enjoyable and highly recommended but much more muted than I would have expected given the lofty reputation...",4.25
Julius,"Smell is all ripe mango with a faint hint of peach. Pour is a dark orange, and totally opaque with a small head that dissappates fairly quickly.

The chocolate goodness lingered in the aftertaste.Mouthfeel - The feel was thick and sticky, clinging to the sides and top of the tongue.Overall - This beer was definitely hype worthy.",5
Assassin,"A: A carbon black discharge to the carafe with a tap shoe hue, while the decanter rests on a woodsmoke tone, before the radiance pins a coloration near Kurotobi. The transfer(s) occur across natural nucleated sites, which avoids the unwanted lipids/impurities on the cross-reactions, for solidifications. Accordingly, a collar formation to the inch, as latticework – marginally – pushes through a rushed retreat. The brim comes in towards the .25in, which clings to the periods that reach 1cm, while the hours further the detachments per the foam-negative materials. With this in mind, the palette to the neck has a dark beige peak, as the rushed retreat has a mars brown rim. In turn, a viscosity factor that plays to the annulling properties aforesaid, which support the nuanced droplets that attune the advanced (teary) archesS: Malts frame the dexterities above a soft hop bill, while the oak casks work to build a complicated mass around the aged aldehydes. An ignition that politely connotes La Bête Noire with a Cajeta glaze, as figgy duff pairs alongside prunes + flame raisins. There is an oak stave to plank presence in exercise, which adds a dynamic balance to the sweet midsections. Supplementary to this, a calm hop effect that reinforces the barrel toned landscapes, when symbolizing forested alder to shagbark hickory. All the while, a ventilated deduction on the vintage, beyond the bettering cask aspects. This comes at a trained interval, which nears ≥68°F, for softening & blooming the – hourly – abstractions. Correspondingly, an enlightened (smart) complication that comes without additives, where the stability is maintained & rooted through coordination. The progression optimizes the breathing periods, by characterizing Palo Cortado through rawhide over clay pipes, outside the dried fruit subtexts over Atomic Fireballs. Moreover, a structure that continuously engages in complex polymers, when denoting lignins across tannins, in the act of rolling dry constitutionsT: Soft barrel entitlements to the conversions set by diastatic enzymes, where hemicelluloses contribute to the cultured caramelization(s). Namely, maltol developments to the plot, for signifying doughy accounts on Nussbrezels under a Crème brûlée guise, as bourbon coats Chelan cherries + Moyer plums. The notations have a light implication on the makings that analog MalvaBons, while lightly addressing the oak lactones thru coconut. The age offers a refined sense on the phenolic aldehydes, as they lend vanilla by vanillin, which comes with a molasses – charred – nature. Howbeit, cautious to not exceedingly burn amid the oxidized transfers, across the carafe, where Fahrenheit gets incrementally pushed. There is a leathery standing behind the hydrolysable workings, which offer a steadying composure to the sweet malt passages. This is furthered by a low toned bitterness, when detailing the dark rosin inflections. Sequentially, a blooming allowance that recapitulates the sensed perceptions on sherry, where an oxidized nuttiness supplants English toffee. The sequences have dry – tannin derived – cessations, while carefully regulating spiced eugenols & smoked guaiacols, against the softly spoken (developed) acetaldehydesM: An intensity behind C₂H₆O that’s courteous to not suffocate, when attenuating sweetness. Thus, a treacly to thick mitigation with an alleviating bite, while the smooth ebullitions amalgamate over the tempered – carbonated – tiers. A feel that’s accompanied by age, besides the aeriated drafts, for paving a weathered maturityO: The degradations on hemicelluloses are rich in their pursuit on furfurals above ethyl acetates, which is fittingly appropriate, for perceiving malt. Oak compounds are continuous in the upsurge, of clocked intervals, as they are paired alongside the relaxed wooded hops. Correspondingly, a construction that offers more harmony, when providing the time with an uncapped patience",4.75

Little to no coffee.Taste: The strong maple sweetness and the bourbon are noticeable first. Some chocolate is there, but very little coffee except for some bitterness in the aftertaste. The lack of an overwhelming coffee taste works well here, as it lets the maple and bourbon shine but provides just enough bitterness to offset the maple sweetness.Feel: Silky and smooth with a moderate bite on the back end.

The coffee cannot be noticed until fairly late in the sip. The alcohol is noticeable and provides a bit of a sting at the end along with warmth.Feel:Smooth, silky and mouth-coating. Very noticeable warmth and a sting from the alcohol. The body is medium-full.Overall:A very nice Imperial Stout. Complex. This brew is definitely sweet, which makes it a dessert beer for me.Just to note - this beer is 2.5 years old. That must have had an effect.",4.35
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"2019 bomber, poured at 53° into a Founders Brewing sniffer.Age said no head, so this pours flat black with just a whisper of beige foam that ghosted out fast.Awesome room-filling aroma of fresh pulled espresso, a chocolatiers best offering in his shop, quite light bourbon too.Bold flavor - but god awful sweet - tastes of dark chocolate covered coffee beans, vanilla, maple syrup, a bit of mild tobacco. Finishes short with barrel and maple leaf candy left on the palate. Burp of coffee. Sticky lip.Thick. Really thick. Almost no carbonation at all.Overall, this fine elixir would’ve been better served two years ago, rather than letting it sit this long. A beattiful effort nonetheless.,.",4.4
Samuel,"2020 vintage at the brewery bottled.White head. Lace. Clear yellow gold color. Beautiful beer.A bit tart, a bit citrusy, but refreshing and balanced. Green apples, white wine, and grapes. Earthy, wheat, light saison spice, but not like a Belgian saison. More subtle. Fruity, but drinks like a white wine. Fairly dry, but bubbly.Very enjoyable and worth the hype. Can’t believe I finally got to try this one.",4.75
Samuel,"This is mild honeyed sweetness, light lemony, great funky, and super smooth.",4.56
Samuel,"b3, bottled 8-27-20, poured from a 750mL bottle into a SP “cheers” stemmed wine glass. pours a foggy orange with a fluffy white foam head. foam dissipates but lingers as a thick white foam collar around the glass. aromas of white wine, lemon, honey, hay, oak all in perfect harmony. taste follows with a bright lemony tart finish. full mouthfeel. as it warms it takes on more white wine qualities. pleasantly tart. perfectly carbonated. amazing beer.",4.94
Samuel,"Slightly foggy but bright yellow with a soft white head that retains well.Insanely refreshing and softly effervescent up front, it starts with melon and peach characteristics, but then subsequent sips allow subtle farmhouse funk and oak to develop, while even adding hints of passion fruit seed as it warms. The medium-light body then comes to a bone dry finish.Batch 4.---On the evening of March 10th, 2023, I had the pleasure of enjoying a batch 2 bottle thanks to the contrite generosity of a long lost friend, ultimately coming away enjoying it even more than b4.Here, an oaky funk pairs with an impressive array of stonefruits and pear accompanied by a beautiful bouquet of herbal accents, including a hint of spearmint, making for an absurdly unique yet ever delicate expression. Unlike b4, I do actually feel that I perceive the faintest hint of buckwheat here, which provides a satisfying comfort in a small but substantial way.This beer exhibits such unbelievable balance and complexity that it may be their best barrel aged saison, and I find myself increasing my already very high score of 4.76.",4.94
Abner,"Such a well balanced beer. Hill Farmstead doesn't go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. While labeled a NE IPA, is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles, similar to Focal Banger. Definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty, oaty finish. Partly hoppy and partly rustic, Abner is a expertly minimalist IPA. They do all the little things right.",4.92
Abner,"A really great double IPA! Had a pint at The Bench restaurant in Stowe VT. Pours a hazy orange color with a good size white head and good lacing on the glass. Mostly citrus aroma but nicely balanced with hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and moderately bitter. An outstanding Double IPA!!",4.74
Abner,Definitely a double. The alcohol flavor is produced more so than other hill farmstead beers. However the beer is truly a HF beer with the deep caramel hue and succinct crisp hoppiness that is so refined. Amazing beer but I prefer a lower alcohol beer.,4.69
Abner,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place.Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.Feel: Clean and full at the same time. Medium carbonation. Quite crushable.Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. Some unexpected notes (smoke, gummy bears) are also in the mix, but everything fits in seamlessly. I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder. Great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of Hill Farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles.",4.25
Abner,"Draft at Armsby AbbeyWell damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try thisPours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacingFor the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rindIt’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerineA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balancedHoly shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need more",4.87
Framboise Du Fermier,"This is another lactic SP sour that slaps you right in the face! Thankfully, it’s also full of raspberry dopeness, and I can get behind that part fosho",4.65
Framboise Du Fermier,"Interesting plum-hued body with a bit of haze and a sudsy off-white head produced with moderate pour. Overripe raspberry billows out of the glass, with additional aromatics of fruit leather, champagne, and wildflowers. Very lovely although not particularly complex. Flavors lean tart, as per usual with SP, although the intense raspberry really helps balance things out here. Kinda like eating a raspberry with a lot of seeds, resulting in a more tart, tannic character. Feel is light, astringent and puckering. Overall pretty decent, reminds me of Drie Fonteinen's Framboos (and at a similar price point, $50/750ml)87/100",4.69
Framboise Du Fermier,"750 ml bottle, poured into a New Glarus glass at ~40 degrees F.L: Pours a clear bright ruby-garnet red, at least for the first pour.

Double Sunshine,"Poured from the can into a Lawson's branded tulip/goblet glass. Canned April 26th 2023.Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention. Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance.Delicious aroma. Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes. A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality.The mouthfeel on this is just unreal. An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat. Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness. Campfire like warmth in the back palate, that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine.Fantastic IPA, and hardly any hint of big abv now that I think of it. Just killer stuff.",4.32
Double Sunshine,"This stuff is an absolute treat!L: Pours a deep golden, yet clear in the glass. Fluffy, white head of 3 fingers lasts through the session.S: Smells of grapefruit, citrus, dank hops, and sweet bread malt.T: Grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning, the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit. These dank, citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh. It finishes clean, especially for a DIPA.F: Nice level of carbonation, feels smooth and finishes clean. Incredibly drinkable for a session. Just be careful with DIPAs with this level of drinkability.O: Incredibly well balanced DIPA with an excellent flavor profile. This might be my favorite DIPA I have tried to date.",4.85
Double Sunshine,A little disappointing. Overall a solid IPA but just expected better after having Sips of Sunshine. Surprised at the perfect 100 rating. A more citrusy flavor than Sips with a noticeable grapefruit taste and not as smooth. I’d recommend as a much lighter double IPA for those that don’t prefer the heavy types.,4.75

That said, if you hand me one of these, I'm gonna drink it. Smiling.",4.5
JJJuliusss!,"Its with a jaw tightening, lip smacking, mouth watering series of sensations that gives Tree House's power packed Julius a newer and juicier life that'll leave us stuttering for more.The excellence in Jjjuliusss is felt starting with a similarly creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures as the original Julius. The beer's dense and foggy appearance only works to make it more appetizing. A slow separation of ale from froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to an even more creamy, tangy, sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and piney perfume than any before.Less grassy and herbal in taste, the flavors that explode on the middle palate are dominant with all-things-orange. Tangerine, in all its tangy, fructose-sweet, branch-ripe and fresh squeezed vibrance springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting taste, a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus zest apply their final and lasting contributions to balance.Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts fuller and plush, but trailing bitter, herbal and dry, the soft sappiness of freshly shaven spruce links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns itself with sorbet desserts- Its surprising that a single sixteen ounce can can hold so much flavor.",4.73

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"A nice BA coffee stout. Very thin for today's market, which is an attribute in general to me but this one goes a little too far into the cold brew coffee territory.Nose is excellent light roast coffee. Floral notes over dark chocolate, classic diner coffee, and some charred malt. Taste follows with the cold brew coffee note taking the lead.Great stuff. Not sure it's worth the premium over regular Speedway everyday. But now and again it definitely is.",4.54
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"Great look, black with a good amount of tan head. Smell is amazing with coffee/vanilla/oak/bourbon.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"2022. Bought for ~15$ at Alesmith's brewery in San Diego, CA for a beer tasting with my buddy Ron. Just a few quick notes because during these tastings I don't spend too much time writing.A&S: Decent caramel-colored head, with some lacing. Black, but not jet-black colored beer. The aroma has chocolate and caramel components and is not ""in your face"".T&M: The vanilla dominates. The beer is light but flavorful. Oaky is a major component as well. 14.2 is very deceptive especially before it warms. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. The carbonation is on the higher side of medium.Overall: Very solid, would recommend.",4.93

Dinner,"Poured on tap a snifter at Churchkey DC.Beaming pale gold, with hints of orange color, and some fine carbonation. Soft creamy top of finger presented, with an off white appearance and bowled tilted lacing.Aroma is a wonderful spiced orange. Juiced Christmas mandarin nose, with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops. Soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose.Palate is richly good, but no surprises. Creamy sensing body along with the flavors, if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive. Mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes. Finish accentuates soft green herbs, to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor, and sharper astringency like a soft pine. Still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness, and that classic Creamsicle orange like flavor.It's not that exotic or dynamic, just a solid ipa done with exceptional base flavors. Very nice!",4.49
Dinner,"So happy to finally try this historic IPA.Mango, pineapple, and a slightly dank herbaceous quality on the nose. Palate is sharp and clean with pine, hints of green onion, and overripe oranges. Mildly sweet malt undertones balance the profile. Finishes clean and lightly bitter. Superb.",4.62
Dinner,"One month old. Bottle to wine glass.L: Pours an opaque golden orange with a foamy white head that leaves plenty of lacing. No floaters.S: Hoppy, floral and fruity with notes of pineapple, mango and sweet citrus fruits. Slightly piney and resinous.T: First sweet and fruity, then bitter, grassy and piney. Sweet tropical fruits like pineapple and mango are paired with floral and herbal notes. Grapefruit peel is also there. Some earthy and woody undertones, too.F: Full and a bit sticky on the one side, crisp and crushable on the other side. Medium carbonation.

Duck Duck Gooze,"At long last! It was always scandalous to me that the top rated gueuze on this site was from outside belgium, and while I still feel this is not the best gueuze I have ever had, I can now see why it is in that echelon of the style. Cloudy yellow pour, finger of sudsy white foam, good mix of spotted and splotchy lacing. Lemon, sliced tart apple, lacto, barnyard funk, white grape, flowers, hay and earthy oak in the potent nose. Taste is just as potent, but not as complex as the sour notes lead more than the barnyard funk, oak backs the sour fruits well, slight earth, yogurt funk, and decent hay round out. A more sunny disposition for the style, leans sour more than funky but both present in spades, but the body is light and nuanced despite the potency. I would love to age a bottle of this as I think it would age really nicely!",4.75

Aroma has tons of funk, well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. Overall a wonderful smelling beer.Taste picks up right where the nose left off. I get apricots, wine barrel, apple vinegar, lemon, hay and general barnyard funk. Acidity is spot on. Tart, but it doesn't beat you over the head, allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. Light bodied, bright, crisp and clean.Overall, an absolutely wonderful beer.",4.68
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the Cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping. As the freshly, horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket, it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before I gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothie-like stream into the glass. There it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head.I said St. Lam was the juiciest Loon? Scratch that, this is like Schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity. Even still, a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre. A delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms.I'm not sure I ever imagined just what made LPK the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is, but clearly, that distinguisher is decadence. This is undoubtedly the thickest lambic I've ever had, and in all the most delicious ways.",4.25
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.2018. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes.",4.5

Morning Wood,"2017 vintageBeer 1400!!! I purposely saved this one for this landmark review since I reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back. This has been a long time want of mine, and luckily I was able to get the whole series at once. This bourbon barrel-aged variant has been sitting at the highest rated Imperial Porter for a long time on BA, and #38 overall. Let’s see if it lives up to the hypePours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacingThe bourbon is definitely present in the nose, making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, charred oak, salty bacon, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and light brown sugarIt’s an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste, wow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting smoky bacon, milk chocolate, maple candy, sweetened coffee, sweet bourbon, raisin, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of salty bacon, charred oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, smoked malt, and vanillaA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer.

Morning Wood,"22oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle, but was told this was a 2018 vintage of Morning Wood.Poured into Durobar Charente glass.Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down.Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all.Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure.",4.71
Morning Wood,"Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish.",1

Some coffee tones and darker fruits. Smooth chocolate finish with some mild hints of booze. Great taste and pleasantly surprised by the subdued alcohol boozy presence throughout the sampling. Very rich beer.Feel -Lower carbonation, minimal boozy sting and a lighter body than expected.Overall - Great beer that I feel privileged to try.

Parabola,"L: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - Jet black pour with a decent head appearing. About 3 fingers length to be exact. No lacing left behind as the foam dissolves back into liquid form.S: Getting a sweet bourbon cherry aroma from the first sniff, can definitely smell some coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and oak in there. Very well done on the nose! It hit all the marks that they advertised and it was very noticeable/ well balanced. This deserves a 5/5 for me.T: Tasting bourbon, cherry up front as the nose indicates. Getting some big coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak as the nose followed. It's rare the nose is tasting the exact same in a similar order to the nose.F: A good sipper - easy to sip in my opinion, full bodied, medium acidity.O: I can see why this is a world class beer. this big 13.5% beer showed us what we can expect on the firestone walker website and this is exactly what we got. I tried to look for more flavors and one can argue it can have some dark fruits but I would say it's pretty rare a beer company hits it spot on and actually tastes good. Good job firestone, I applaud you for this one.",4.49
Parabola,"2022. It didn't taste like a Russian Imperial Stout to me, too sweet, in fact I think Rasputin is a better representative. And forget about comparing it to Sam Smith's RIS. I was thankful the bourbon still came through strong which did a lot for the taste. I think the most noticeable things about this beer are its ABV of 14.1% and it's ""weight"", both of which put it in the one-and-done category...and that's if you can finish the 12 oz bottle, which I was barely able to do after about 2 hours from the time I poured it. The ABV and the weight really work against the enjoyability of this beer.",4.5
Parabola,"Drinking a 2017, which I've had in the cellar. I am not an expert on the true evaluation of the RIS but I fell in love with this one after my first trip to Firestone/Walker in El Paso de Robles about 12 or 13 years ago. This started me on RIS style. F/W have a cellar room where you can buy the good stuff. I recommend a visit, as the wine country out there is fabulous and F/W is affiliated with many of the wineries (sourcing casks, mixers, etc). The beer is complex and has so many taste notes to it that I won't try to guess them all. It should satisfy almost anyone. I highly recommend putting one away for a few years. I have a few more. Tonight my wife is celebrating her 60th, and I will be having a 5 year old Deschutes Abyss or two after the Tomahawk Ribeye BBQ tonight. But for now, nothing better to set off this great celebration than my all time favorite, Parabola!",4.74
Parabola,"2021 vintage 12 ounce bottle, poured at 53° into a Firestone Walker snifter.Perfect brown head rises above a deep black sea and leaves a nice ring inside the glass. Drizzly lacing.Smells wonderful - dark malt, chocolate, coffee, prune, licorice, barrel char.Drinking like a millionaire. All of the aromas spill forth into the mouth and everybody takes a bow. Multiple barrels makes for a taster’s experience. The peppery spice of the rye barrel carries long, which helps cut into the sweet elements of this Russian Imperial Stout. Vanilla. Fudge. Barrel.,. on and on.Feel is not overly dense, which I appreciate. Medium carbonation.Overall - World Class Stout and totally worthy. The art of the craft!",4.63
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023. Poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move.Vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy, off-white foam like a well-made cappuccino. Excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass. Beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights. Some haze and fine carbonation.Immediate malt on opening, like walking into a bakery. Warm, whole grain type bread. Putting my nose into the glass, my impression is of balance. It's subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes, but I get cherry, a bit of almond, orange peel, and a light mineral aspect. The expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subduedTaste is the expected clove and banana, plus brown sugar, cardamom, cream. Back notes of coffee beans and mineral water.Mouthfeel starts out with a Sprite-like effervescence calming to a velvety, creamy texture from the head.Drinkability? Yeah, it's drinkable. If you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session, sure, you could do it. But after only one bottle I can already tell I'm starting to miss subtleties that I picked up at the beginning. Much more affordable beers to tie one off with. But for any Beer Advocate, this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list.",4.31

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Drank this is a Belgian beer cafe in Warsaw Old Town a few years ago, so reviewing from memory. It was definitely kind of expensive, but not as expensive as I was expecting. On a cold, snowy, lonely night...it seemed the perfect idea.It definitely looks as beautiful as any beer I have seen. Deep, dark and mystical. And I remember the aromas being similar...deep and mystical...and complex.I remember it being mega smooth. My initial impression was that this is much better than Rochefort 8 and 10. Much much better. As I have never been a fan of either. This has much more complexity, and is less creamy...and kind of dark and full of different flavour sensations that are difficult to put into words. However as I am reviewing from memory, I will need to review again when I actually have one with me when I am writing.So yes, this is kind of a vague review, but I don't remember liking it more than a mega amazing West Coast IPA, or even a Chouffe IPA. It was kind of like a Chimay Bleu but wth much more complexity. So these ratings are my approximated memories. Ciao",3.65
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Bottle courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ.Actually drank this about a year ago with two friends I was sharing bottles with. We did a side-by-side with St Bernardus Abt 12, long my favorite Quad. Although I've left alone my ridiculous scoring of that one (from around 20yrs ago) as it was an amazing experience for me at the time, this actually was the superior beer. I just score a lot more realistically these days, compared to when I was a NOOB and whose mind had just been blown by my first Quadrupel Ale.",5
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Got a chance to try this in Amsterdam from a bar that has a guy drive into Belgium every three weeks to pick up a case from various Trappist breweries. The praise for this beer is well-earned. Probably the finest beer I have ever had, and certainly the best quad, even better than my beloved Abt 12. There is nothing at fault with it. It is a lovely experience. I hope I have a chance to try it again one day.",4.94
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Such an amazing beer! The ""Westy"" is the Unicorn of Beers. I bought 48 Bottles (2 crates) at the Abbey in Dec 2017. Still have about 15 bottles left. Its been interesting experiencing them age over time. They are still drinking well, but IMHO I think they peaked after about 3 years.I did a side by side tasting party in 2019 including beers from all 6 Belgian Trappist Ales (Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Bleue, Rochefort 10, Orval, Achel Brune, Westvleteren 12(St Sixtus Abbey), and others (St Bernardus 12, Leffe Brune, La Trappe Quad). Many of these are excellent, but the Westy 12 was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of overall complexity and quality. I agree with many of the tasting notes posted before and I wouldn't do it justice to try, but I will say if you enjoy the strong quad style do yourself a favor and try one.OBTW I had to call and hit about 500 busy tones before finally getting through to a Monk and placing my order in 2017; and I had to go in person to the Abbey to pick them up. I believe they now have a website that you can order for delivery. Check their calendar for times and details.",5
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Had at the bar next to the abbey where is is made. Absolutely incredible. The smell is absolutely amazing, predominantly figs, dates, and aged leather. The taste is is even better. Smooth with complex layers of fig, chocolate, and other malted notes. Honestly one of the best beers I've ever had. I'm feel lucky to be able to take home a few of them.",4.19

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Best by 2014 (month has worn away), so, bottled in 2011. A kind gift from my sister-in-law. Poured from a 330mL bottle into my Westvleteren chalice. 10.2% ABV. Served at 55F.Chestnut/burnt umber liquid with copper/caramel highlights and a small beige cap receding quickly to a lasting collar. Adequate retention; fine lacing; delicate yet viscous legs.Lovely rich malty/estery aromatics suggest plum, fig, date, toffee, and an old European cobbler's shop. Weighty yet perfectly integrated and inviting. No perceptible oxidation.Flavor follows the nose but is joined by a low earthy bitterness and some suggestions of brandy and eucalyptus. Long, linear, medium-dry finish. Rounded and rich with some complex stewed fruit elements.Modest carbonation, but holding up well given the age. Slightly thin and quite warming.More than the sum of its parts, and still a top tier example of the style, though I look forward to updating this review one day with a fresh bottle.",4.88

Ann,"2015 batch, which I think is batch #3. Bottle pour from Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro, VT.This one pours a fairly clear golden orange color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing.This smells like lemon peel, tea, honey, grassy funk, white wine, pear skin, melon, Riesling, and a minerally funk.This is my biggest white whale, the beer I have most wanted to try since first trying Hill Farmstead originally 10 years ago. It’s tremendous, just about as good as it gets for saison, but, it wasn’t even the best beer I had from Hill Farmstead on my recent trip. That’s how high the bar is for this long-time favorite brewery of mine. This has soft, subtle, and richly complex flavor to it. There’s the obvious honey, almost like honey-soaked pears, or something like that, with white wine, Riesling grapes, melon, apricot jam, and a floral and minerally funk. All of these flavor descriptions make it seem like it’s a super strong and intense beer – it really isn’t. It’s really delicate, and rewards slower sipping and enjoying.This is light bodied, soft, almost creamy, with a wonderful drinkability. It’s well carbonated, but in a subtle way.This might not be the exact top of the mountain for Hill Farmstead – that’s probably Samuel, or one of the SARA Residency beers. But this is pretty close to the top, and a perfect expression of an already great beer in Anna.",4.75
Ann,On Tap at Finley's Pub in Denver. Very good for the Style,4.74
Maman,"Pours jet black with a still, no foam look. Heavy oily legs cling to the glass after the lightest of swirls. It looks like motor oil that's been run hard through a motor for ten thousand miles - thick, dark, and viscous. Aroma pushes dark fruits, plum, and chocolate across the nose first. Char, barrel, bourbon, and hearty roasty and toasty malts sit behind. Dark fruits is the dominate note, at least, immediately out of the fridge. Mild brownie shows up as the beer warms. Flavor profile is dark fruits, caramel, toffee, tobacco, raisins, fig, plum, and chocolate. The blend of notes conjours up thoughts of barleywines, but retains heavy stout notes via late roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon, barrel, and char are all present to varying degrees, molding into the 14.6% ABV well. Brownie and more chocolate start to show up as the beer warms, masking some of hte initial dark fruit notes. It really develops a wonderful depth to the flavor profile after a fairly simplistic aroma. Mouth feel is thick and viscious, but with an otherwise flat and still effervescence. Overall, a blend of hearty stout and barleywine notes. It has a lot of dark fruits for a heavy stout, but despite that, retains a good balance despite being in wine alcohol territory. Massive slug, so -0.25 from overall.Served in a 15.5oz Speigelau tulip from a 750mL bottle. 2020 Vintage. Consumed/reviewed 02/12/2023 as a Super Bowl warm-up for Chiefs vs. Eagles!",4.5

Fuzzy,"I'm finding I am really enjoying white peaches specifically in wild ales, just lend themselves to barrel, funk and botanicals so well. Here SP has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too. Smell is damn impressive: sour peach, yogurt, barnyard, and barrel funks, bright and rustic oak, pressed flowers, dry earth, a touch of lemon and lime zest, and finished with big hay. Taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits, otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. Feel is sour and decently acidic, but gentle, dries out with various funks, almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. Clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam. This is right up there with the best peach wild ales, little less acidity and it could be the very top",4.5
Fuzzy,"2022 vintageHere we are, the #1 Wild Ale on BA for my 1500th review! This is a special one that has been a long time want for me, so I’m very excited to finally try it.

Fuzzy,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized varianceS: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit mineralsT: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttinessM: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefsO: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition",4.22

KBS,"This is one of my favorite beers I have ever had. It has become my standard to compare other stouts, but nothing has compared to Founders so far. My only complaint is that there seems to be slight differences in taste and feel from batch to batch. However, there is a good chance that it's just a misperception on my part. I have always enjoyed every single one. This one is pretty pricey, but it's worth it 100%.",4.7
KBS,"Really good stout, rivals Dragons Milk which is my favorite readily available stout. Dragons milk has a little bit of a sweet note that I don’t love, and I didn’t detect that with KBS. I do think KBS has a stronger alcohol taste, but I only noticed it on the first couple drinks. Very easy to drink beer, for being 12 ABV.",4.44
KBS,Not for all but all must try.Dark chocolate and coffee fun welcome.,4.79
KBS,"KBS always pours great, deep dark black and smells really great if you like bourbon. The mouth feel is a medium body with that bourbon smell turning into a subtle taste. Becomes more dark chocolate bitter forward as you drink it. The fresher the beer the more bite the bourbon taste has.",5
KBS,"Super good, but not as good as the Toppling Goliath ...",4.36
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Goose Island Bourbon County imperial stout.Now I must say, this is quite quite good. Like very good. Somewhere between a good stout and an aged whiskey, which isn't a surprise based on the drink itself. That being said, it does not exemplify the thing I like most about beer so far being, drinkability. I do like the refreshing nature of a beer quite a bit and that is the only thing I'd say is absent here.At 14.3 percent, it's quite high for a beer, and you feel a lingering alcohol taste towards the end. It is accompanied by some sweet notes like date and chocolate though.Mouthfeel is very unique in that somehow the bubbles feel thick. Like the consistency is buttery and but the bubbles feel heavy for some reason bringing out a very odd and unique, but not off putting, almost soupy texture. Mouthfeel end notes are sticky and also a little velvety or caramel-like.Smell is a little sour and very malt forward, slightly fruity and even slightly-er herby.If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I've been sipping as I write this and am appreciating it more and more. One hell of a beer. If you do grab one, the only thing I can say is that it's not smashable, but should be enjoyed slowly.",4.81
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Finally getting to try this. 2022 vintage, poured from bottle into a snifter.Look: Black-brown-red, thick, oily. Very thin light brown head, no retention except a tiny ring.Smell: Oh wow. Damn, this is pulling no punches. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, malt, bourbon, dark bread, and the tiniest hints of vanilla beans, raisins, and bananas. Incredibly complex.Taste: YUUUUUP. Heavyweight, but incredibly smooth at the same time. Lots of the chocolate, with the vanilla bean and caramel notes playing second and third fiddle. Heavy maltiness and bourbon character, but still incredibly smooth with very little burn for the ABV. Raisin note is slightly present in the back, as well as the faintest banana peeking through once the malt onslaught begins to fade.Feel: Thick but only slightly oily on the palette, light but lingering carbonation. Sticks around a bit, but in a pleasant way and doesn't overstay its welcome. Very slightly syrupy. Really pleasant.Overall: Masterclass of an imperial stout. Has more distinct flavour impressions than most stouts with adjuncts, but is still perfectly balanced. Deserves the hype.",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Opened the 2019 bottle that has been aging in my cellar. Poured into a tulip glass. The chocolate colored head quickly dissipated. Midnight color, smell was extraordinary complex consisting of a beautiful bouquet of chocolate, alcohol, fine whiskey, and espresso. Taste was exceedingly complex. The stout lingered on my palate forever, it seemed. Take your time to sip this beauty as it has a high alcohol content. Overall, a warm stout to enjoy in the midst of a winter storm, near a fireplace. Well done.",4.46
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"2022.A- Pours a beautiful black oily color, perfectly opaque. Hardly any headS-Wow. Rich chocolate, plums, oak,espresso, a bit of whiskey. Probably the best smelling beer I’ve had the pleasure of smelling.T-Chocolate, bourbon, oaky goodness, raisins, coffee. Can’t believe this is 14.5 percent ABV.M- Rich and oilyO- It’s incredible. It lives up to the hype.",4.55
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Pours a deep brown, nearly black.The smell is very reminiscent of whiskey due to the barrel aging. Slight alcohol tinge, but very fruity and sweet smelling. The smell is like raisins or figs. There is a slight fermentation flavor that reminds me of wine, likely due to the high ABV.The flavor is very sweet and low in bitterness. The flavor is extremely malty, and fruity. The taste seems like a cross between a high malt beer, a wine, and a bourbon. Notes of figs, raisins, trailed by syruppy molasses and fermentation flavors.The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy.A very excellent beer",4.21
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This is my favorite stout beer. Since I live in the Chicago area, it's easily accessible. I see some reviews that state KBS is as good or better. I'm writing this review to say that is false.",4.93
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Pours very dark. Dark tan foam. Heavy bourbon aroma. Big flavors. Chocolate, caramel, and oak. Very complex but well balanced. Strong alcohol finish. Beyond excellent. Best imperial stout I've ever had.",4.59
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Look: Pours obsidian black with a very light, copper-colored head.Smell: Strong whiskey and vanilla aromas, along with fudge and coffee.Taste: Silky smooth bourbon and vanilla taste, I’m also getting the hints of chocolate and coffee, and there is also some caramel going on as well. The oak is present as it goes down and just finished the taste perfectly.Feel: Man this is too smooth for how heavy it is. The feel is heavy but this is easily drinkable and just paints the palette with a velvety finish.Overall: Absolute dynamite for the style, this is one of the best out there and lives up to the hype.",4.61

Flora Plum,Solid beer - a bit plum tart aftertaste.,4.59
Flora Plum,"Original bottlingIt is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment",4.9
Flora Plum,"After Flora Pear, this is my favorite Flora. Excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer. Pours a beautiful deep gold, big wine nose, effervescent with plums dancing in the background. Fantastic.",4.59
Flora Plum,"Pours a straw gold. Nose of plum, Lemon, hay, and traditional HF nose. Taste follows with a well blended plum, lemon, hay, minimal acid. Feel is light/medium with medium carb. Overall, this is an excellent fruit beer that is well balanced with the base beer.",4.14
Headroom,"Canned 8/29/23 and shipped to PADefinitely think it borders on living up to the hype - a very good hazy. Super soft and creamy; little grassier than I prefer my IPAs, but this is balanced enough that it's not a detraction nor is it over the top. Glad I finally got the tick on this one, but there are definitely other Trillium hazies I would prefer to this.",4.54
Headroom,Overrated. Highly disappointed. Huge letdown.,4.34
Headroom,Grapefruit sunny D. On draft at Churchkey.,4.36
Headroom,"Pours a very hazy fleshy peach color with a fluffy off white head that leaves ringlets of lace as you enjoy the beer. Gorgeous hazy.The nose is dank and packed with sweet peach aromas, orange peel, some grapefruit, and lots of mango and pineapple. This is literally a beer fruit basket of aromas.The peach flavors lead the taste and are delicious, with the orange, mango, and pineapple flavors following, with a bit of green grapes mid palate and a nice creamy oat flavor on the finish. Very balanced and oh so delicious.The mouthfeel is full, soft, and creamy, adding to the drinkability. This is a magnificent representation of the style, IMHO.",4.3
Headroom,"On tap:Cloudy bruised peach with a typical hazy head that clings to the edges pretty well. Nose is melon and unripe tropical fruits midway through without any agitation. Giving the beer a swirl ripens the fruits pretty quickly, giving a sweeter impression overall (some sniffs expose an overripe burn, but it’s not the norm).When cold, the beer opens with an almost tart fruit note, which contrasts poorly with the more bitter middle and finish. It doesn’t completely disappear as the beer warms, but it does mellow out and blend in better. The sweetness notes in the nose after a swirl pervades the opening through to near the finish, reducing the contrast, but taking the bitterness I enjoyed in the back end of a colder beer.This beer went from a disjointed start with highs and lows to a more balanced, but also more typical, very good hazy.",4.75

Atrial Rubicite,"Blend #11 from May 2021, 5.1% ABV from a 750mL bottle. Just about perfect for a wild ale for me, still a delightful balance of pure, jammy fruit essence, bacterial sourness and funk, and oak tartness. This is what raspberries are made for.",4.5

Atrial Rubicite,"A: Bacterial degradation on the collar, which quickly inches in stature until the hasty retreat. Despite that, a constant longevity to the brim, providing a categorical aptness. In the interim, a trivial exposure on the collars cling, which substantially decreases through the periods. The appearance off the decant comes to a sangria to pansy purple dye, while highlighting pompadour to the carafe, as the vessel (on transfer) missions a bole tinge. On-top, an alabaster cap that brims to a link white per the aforementioned. The coloration presets get stretched on the discharge, as a way to represent a semi-transparent eleganceS: An earthy introduction with a relaxed awareness on esters, as the microbial contagions adhere to the vintage. Confident components to the aged-oppressed raspberries through a matured involvedness, from a ripened oldness to an oxidative mephitis. Howbeit, a calculated fetor that’s initially repressed, as the draw comes with an hourly aridness. With this mind, the presetting notations reap the aggregates, of an array on drupelets ascribing raspberries. The symbolism stretches to a Clafoutis complexion, while remaining seedy and rooted to the additive. All the while, an implication to ethyl hexanoate, where the apple correspondences meld softly to the phenolic spin-offs. Such bonuses speak to the loitering spices found in eugenol, while complimenting the framework over the adjacent ketone (C10H12O2). At no cost, a wet – woodsy – hop effect that lends a resin kindness to the leafy tannins, aside the peppered herbaceous rearguards. The bacterial agents on lactobacillus are present to the caducity, while evolving a Camembert refinedness thru the employed (bottle) conditioning. Sequentially, a more captivating element on the native drivers, which offer a nuanced mustiness to cattle sheds, amid a smirched growth on StinkhornsT: The virulence is perceptible on the cellared acidity, which comes with a well-bred dryness, for yeast explicitness. Nonetheless, a raspberry opulence to not be overtaken, yet an accessory that now parallels the implied draws on clingstone peaches & citron lemons. Markedly, an isoamyl octanoate nexus to the structure, which is supportive to the grains on rusticity. Assuaging hops provide a herbal kick to the eugenol compounds that touch on clove, when pitching resin to the concourse. The age welcomes a pastoral fondness with a vanilla oak consideration to the tannins on berries, as an acetate solvency crawls behind. A movement that expresses abandoned bunker silos, while airing farmland mildew on rabbity phenols. Moreover, an Alpaca wool note that corresponds to damp cattlehide, as a decanted nuttiness formulates aside moldy caverns. Oxidation comes sequentially with an elevated solvency on epoxy, while setting up Sangiovese commonalities. Correspondingly, a move in time that’s deftly degassed, as dry leather nears tobacco, when bordering burnt guaiacolsM: An alleviated sweetness that’s pitted against acidic motorists, which is aeriated intentionally to strategically stabilize. There is a minerality factor that resembles an autumn jog with a soft mist, while tannins support an attenuated dry rider. In this situation, the approach inaugurates a bright vivacity that doesn’t pierce, but rather respects the framework, as a soft texture grows upon the weathered advancementsO: The vintage has an acerbic presence that’s regulated thru wild yeast auras. Phenols that assist esters in an involved growth, while malts gently circulate a toasted granularity. Chiefly, one with an operative uniqueness to the raspberry add-ons, as a bacterial exsiccation maps out",4.75

Atrial Rubicite,"2020 vintage (Blend 10/April 2020); consumed on 7/31/2022Pours a stunningly vivid, blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy, soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time.Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish.Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close.Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout.",3.92

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"Canned 4/6/23I had the OG Ghost In The Machine early last year, and while I enjoyed it quite a bit, I found the hop burn to be a bit of a problem with it. A DDH version sounds like it could make things even worse on that front, but this is a highly regarded beer so I had to order it when I saw it on Tavour. Let’s crack it open and see what it’s all aboutPours a hazy milky yellow with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacingThe nose is aggressive here, but it’s aggressive in a great way that does not suggest hop burn. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, orange juice, bready malt, grassy hops, dank weed, white pepper, and a touch of caramelAnd unfortunately this one also gets a bit too aggressive in taste, but I’m still enjoying it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy hops, orange juice, dank weed, overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, white pepper, and light pine. The swallow brings notes of earthy hops, dank weed, orange juice, overripe cantaloupe, pithy grapefruit, bready malt, pine, pineapple juice, and an odd hint of gasolineA medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and bitter because of the hops burn, but it eventually settles outI really wanted this one to be better than the original, but it’s really about the same. A bit less hop burn leads to a greater drinkability, but the odd gasoline note prevents me from bumping up the taste score",4.13

The double dry-hopping process really shines through in the aroma, with a depth and complexity that is unmatched.On the palate, the beer is just as impressive. The first sip is bursting with juicy hop flavors, with mango, passionfruit, and grapefruit dominating the taste profile. The bitterness is well-balanced and not overpowering, allowing the fruity flavors to shine through.

Carbonation was visible.Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison.Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this.",4.27
Abricot Du Fermier,"Pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency. Transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head never forms. Aroma is apricot right off the cuff, although it's mild and nuanced into the profile. Stone, lemongrass, and earth add some more depth. It has a pleasant tartness to it, leaning into a little acidity. Flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch, especially when served at fridge temperature. The acidity wanes as the beer warms. Apricot adds some sweetness, and is more forward than the nose, taking up a more dominate role. It's still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. Cellar stone, earthy malts, grass, and lemon zest create the rest of the profile, all accompanied by some minor tartness. Mouth feel is still in effervescence, delivering a smooth texture.

Really nice balance of funk and citrus.The palate is tart and predominantly fruity, with a bit of a tightening pucker on the back of the palate and a long, mildly acidic finish. Nice juiciness to the overall profile.A touch of dryness, with a soft finish and gentle lingering tannin.",4.6
Cable Car,"2019 version, drank 06.19.22 out of a Hill Farmstead bulbous wine glass. Straw color with very delicate islands of head but other than that, not to much there. Not too much nose either. Funky and acidy taste, strong. Very pungent, strong and tasty. Pretty amazing beer. Just wow.",4.89
Oude Geuze Vintage,2016 edition from last year. 375 ml bottle. A little oak on the nose. Just enough carbonation to make the mouthfeel great. Taste makes me want to drink it all day.,3.6
Zombie Dust,"Yeah man, the reviews and the hype are spot on here. My friend, who only drinks Busch Light, had 2 cans in his fridge and I about had a dang heart attack. This beer isn't available in may area but his friend from out of town had left them and he let me try them. HOLY COW! I was blown away that a pale ale could be so complex. Honestly it was almost perfect in every way. Not too hoppy or malty. Great mouthfeel and perfectly balanced flavor with some fruit notes up front. Trust me when I say it's one of the best beers out there, period.",4.48
Zombie Dust,"Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is slightly hazed gold, head presents 1 finger thick, dissipates to solid top with some lacing.Smell is crisp citric and earth hops, pale malt, light toast.Taste is hop forward - notes of citrus, earth, light pine, pale malt and lighter caramel and toast, some herbal qualities emerge with warmth.Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness.Overall a very good APA - it does seem slightly aged, so would like to try again closer to canning date but even still would expect a bit more malt out of an APA this highly rated.",4.5
Zombie Dust,"This is an old school West Coast IPA, not bad just out of fashion with new hszy craze. This one delivers the malt and hops, 10 years ago my revies may have been more favorable.",4.25
Zombie Dust,"A very good beer, if you were an IPA fan. I had it on draft in Leesburg Virginia and it’s from Indiana?! This would compete with any West Coast beer",4.97
Zombie Dust,"12 oz can from Total Wine in Short Pump, VA The ale poured a hazy amber with a white foamy head and lacing. The aroma of citrus, mostly grapefruit and orange. The flavors are mostly grapefruit and pale malts. The ale has a medium body and average carbonation. This is a top-notch pale ale.",4.16
Zombie Dust,"The hops are assertive, even bitter in the aftertaste, but not painful. A slight sweetness and juicy fruitiness on the nose and at first sip before the hops crash in. Great combination of late-boil aroma hops and early-boil bittering hops. The flavor is dynamic (not static) as you sip. This is a beer for someone who likes bitter. 3 Floyds is one of the benefits to living in the Midwest, right after the cost of living and the sweetcorn.",4.02
Zombie Dust,"Solid Pale Ale. It is a bit light on the tongue, but other than that really nice and truly well balanced.",4

Zombie Dust,"12oz brown bottleThree Floyds Zombie Dust has a clear gold/amber colored body and atop sat a 1 ½-finger white foamy head. The head had good retention and left behind nice lacing. The nose was dominated by citrus; grapefruit, orange, and lemon were noted. The taste follows the nose but is fuller and light malt is also evident. The finish is bitter and dry. Mouth feel is medium bodied that is crisp, and dry with a bitter finish.Zombie Dust is a well-made American Pale Ale that is a little too hoppy for this non hophead.",4.1
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass.Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing.Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles.Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much.Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further.Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like.",3.85
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2022 pint can, chilled, left to warm. Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast.Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together.Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout?Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated.",4.49
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer.Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. Nice legs. Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way. Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins. That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great.Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right. A bit less and they wouldn't be notable. A bit more and they would overpower. There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming.Overall this is excellent.",4.5
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2018 vintageWe’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all aboutPours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacingThis is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oakThis is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffeeA full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heatWhile I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still",4.48
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 ""Amalie Arena"" edition...large capped bottle.Pours very dark with no light shining through, next to no cap or lacing.Dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.Super smooth, nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.Delicious creation, no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar, if ya have the opportunity.",4.46

The citrus pith bitterness is strong in this one, which I love. Strong citrusy scent right off the bat too. Tropical juiciness, peach and pineapple tantalize the taste buds. Hoppy finish lingers. This brew is excellent and even better when paired with Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix. Acting funny but I don't know why, Excuse me while I kiss the sky. Cheers!",4.5
Haze,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 4/21, so 3 weeks oldThick pale orange juice body with a persistent white head leaving rings of lacing. Muted aroma of tropical fruit, which becomes massive in the taste. Medium hop bite for balance, thick mouthfeel, outstanding beer.",4.35

Doppelganger,"Pours a hazy orange yellow color. Super juicy tropical flavors, and about as dank as Tree House gets outside of the Bright series. Slightly floral, with a subtle grapefruit taste. It's smooth and silky as most Tree House hazies end up being. Very above average beer.",4.56
Doppelganger,"Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in October 2022. There was a canned date of 04/19/22 @ 05:59:33 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank about 2 months from purchase.Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.This is an excellent New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. Another outstanding IPA from Tree House. I like the overall balance, and would buy this again.",4.53

Then a strong but not over-powering floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time.",4.5

Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Likely the best pale ale I've ever had. Just hits every note - perfect balance, ton of flavor. If I could have this in my beer fridge at all times, I would. It just curb stomps the vast majority of pale ales I've had. Great citrus flavors, nice body. Surprising high ABV for a pale, which probably helps the flavor profile, but I'm not taking that as a detraction - this is a fantastic beverage.",4.44
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Deep orange in color. No head created, at all. Nose was the least desirable quality, mainly due to not much there, especially given the color and extreme citrus taste. Taste is the magical moment. Superb beer. Surprised it is not considered a NE Style though.",3.04
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"2022-03-0616oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14.Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty. This is a very good beer.",4.5
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"One month old. Can to wine glass.Look: Pours a pale, but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. No floaters.Smell: Fresh citrus notes. Mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit.Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness.Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.Overall: Full and juicy Pale Ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. Could easily be mistaken for a DIPA. Very challenging compared to other Pale Ales with its full body and its dry finish. Great beer. Very intense.",4.49
Cable Car Kriek,"2021 vintage. Ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever. Aromas are pretty standard kriek: cherry pie, lemon, hay, bit of vinegar. Very little funk, which is a bit unusual. Flavors are acetic but also semi-sweet, with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. Feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation. Overall I think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of Belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the US, but now that we have broader access to some of the best Belgium offerings here in the states it doesn't quite hold up. Especially given the price point ($90/750ml), I would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity.64/100",4.37
Cable Car Kriek,2021,4.53
Cable Car Kriek,"2021 Vintage.Gorgeous ruby red pour; very few agitated bubbles of carbonation as it’s poured into the glass. It settles flat.The nose is still distinctly Cable Car, with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus. The cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh, fruity addition. With time, a lot of oak and Brett comes to the forefront.The palate is sour and noticeably acidic, with a surprisingly low carbonation. Was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid, but overall it’s never overwhelming. The tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile.As stated above, not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high, but I felt it needed more. That said, it drinks bright and refreshing, with restrained tannin.",4.56
Swish,"Pale, opaque orange with thin tan head. Standard hazy look. Smell is complex with pithy rind, orange, vanilla, and malts. Similar smell to some of the Hill Farmstead IPAs. Extremely bright taste with tons of tropical, sweet notes however has a nice bitterness at the end. Pleasing feel that doesn't linger too long. Swish is a spectacular hazy that stands uniquely in a sea of copy cats.",4.49
Swish,"Bissell Brothers is the Larry Bird/Magic Johnson of breweries to me. Not a knock at all, but my MJ is the Alchemist. That being said, the Swish drops in to my stomach like a Steph Curry logo 3 point shot. Nothing but net, all swish. Beautiful Laker gold color. Completely opaque with a slight bubbly froth. On the nose you get Phoenix Suns orange with some Miami Heat tropical pineapple notes. Was expecting a thick Shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body, reminiscent of a Dwight Howard. Taste wise you get the traditional IPA bitter hop bite that gives a slight Celtics green herby taste. However it also has that new wave NEIPA melon, cream, citrus fruit flavor. The NEIPA is the new dynasty, the Golden State Warriors of the beer industry. What an absolute treat, go Nuggets.",4.29

The Broken Truck,"Pours golden with frothy soap off white head. Mustyness and wash rind cheese with a touch of apple flesh on the nose. The first thing that stands out is that this is soft - it doesn't have any commandeering characteristics that detract from the others. I get some apple, some arugula bitterness, with restrained acidity. Maybe some musty sour cherry too, kinda like what you get in a kriek but very much more subtle. This is an excellent excellent spon beer. One of the best beers of this variety I've had in some time.",4.5
The Broken Truck,"Man if I had to put potentially the best beers of 2022 against each other, it might be this and that Gueuze from New Glarus. Whooo boy, some good'uns. This is the '22 bottle.Pours yellow out on the river. Summer winding down, let's finish it up. Hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes. And they said it couldn't be done on this side of the pond. Just a delight to smell. The best of what Tilamook has to offer. Boasts fresh french oak feels, bugs, grapefruit, lemon rind, bleu cheese, green apple yogurt. The gang's all here.The taste was such a nice thing, great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers. Made it memorable. Its vibrant, fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer. One of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer. Sawft body too, never felt too acidic or sour. This is honestly better than most Belgian gueuzes. I realize given the demographics of beer nerds, they're going to keep fetishizing Western Europe, but I'll be more than happy to take any of these Wisconsin and Oregon gems off your hands.",4.5
The Broken Truck,"Opened up No. 6 (1/20), 7 (1/21), and 8 (1/22) together and tasted side-by-side.All three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour, with frothy, aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer.No.6 brought notes of lemon zest, oak, and white grape must on a sweet, musty backbone. No. 7 came on sweeter, with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less Brett character. The oak component had more of a ""freshly cut"" aroma to it, and preceded notes of bleu cheese that I didn't get on No.6. No.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7, but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky.The palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. The oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill, however while No.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness, 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. No. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness.Light-bodied, dry, and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three. As mentioned, varying levels of tartness / acid, but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish.Overall, I'm honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. Each had their own unique nuances, but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both, characterizing a predominance of fresh oak, Brett, bitter citrus, drying tannin, and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. Definitely fun to have these all side-by-side.",4.68
The Broken Truck,"OG batch 1 Broken Truck.Classic de Garde taste, similar in quality to all of the ""Bu"" beers that were bottled during the brewery's infancy.It lacks the nuance of Trevor's newer offerings; minimal funk, lesser barrel treatment, aggressively sour.Overall, a legendary beer whose story was greater than its contents.",4.5
The Broken Truck,"Appearance - The beer, from a double sealed bottle, poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head.Smell - The brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness.Taste - Grass, green apples, and a brett character that really stands out. The finish had a bitter earthy quality. It was not particularly sour, but it definitely brought the funk.Mouthfeel - The carbonation was aggressive, quickly sweeping away any sweetness.Overall - No fruits or adjuncts are needed. This was great.",4.59

Triple Shot,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head.Smell - The beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile.Taste - Overall, this was like espresso with a huge body. There were notes of fresh roasted coffee, fudge, chocolate ice cream, and just a hint of vanilla. The sweetness came out more in the finish. In the big picture, it was an assault of espresso.Mouthfeel - The beer had a nice thick clingy body. It allowed the bitterness to linger.Overall - This was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee. Finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge.",4.48
Triple Shot,"Nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about—water, slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffee.but it tastes fantastic: deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout. Cheers.",4.85
Focal Banger,"Heady Topper has a thick, off-white head and a mostly-clear, golden appearance, with lots of suspended sediment, throughout. The aroma is of citrus, hop resins, and white bread.

Focal Banger,"Enjoying on the front porch, gorgeous, cool August day, the 18th, 2023. (Canned on 8/15/23!)So excited to find this treasure at our Washington beer store.Gorgeous straw/light golden color, slightly hazy, with white foam of tiny bubbles, dissipated quickly leaving fine lace on glass edge.Very fruity aromas of pineapple, papaya, mango, luscious lemon and even malt!Immediate bitter hits the tongue which gives way to the fruit flavors and ends sharp grapefruit rind.This hits all the right notes for an excellent NEIPA for me! Leah prefers the sweeter Heady Topper, whereas I'll stick to this one as my favorite!Edit.... We had bought two cans, and we drank the second one fiber nights after the first one. I had worked hard on a pool electrical job in the sun that day, and WOW!... What an intense beer to drink after a hot day on the sun. By the time we were on the porch, it had cooled off considerably, and it was raining..... Drinking this Focal Banger was pure joy! Pine, hop, depth, in your face hoppy bitterness.....

The light pale malt base displays the grapefruit forward hops and it tastes like the pink grapefruit fresh off my tree at my old PHX house in the spring. Finishes with a superb rind and pine bitterness; 7/10 on my scale.Mouthfeel is light bodied with each sip very refreshing.Overall, yep, the hype is correct on this one. This is a world class ipa!",5
Focal Banger,"Canned on 7/18/23 - Just 15 days ago!Drank most from can as directed, but did pour 4 oz amount in rocks glass for appearanceAppearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed lime-yellow color with a small head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.Smell – The aroma is strong of a grapefruit and herbal hop smell mixed with notes of cracker malt and a touch of bread and toast. Other hop aromas of pine and earth, are there as well, with all the aromas having a fresh “raw” like smell. Hints of caramel and a sizeable grass like smell are there as well, giving a rather green smell overall.Taste – The taste begins with a crisp cracker malt body paired with a lot of the “raw” hop that was present in the nose. An herbal hop is the biggest, but is accompanied by a decent showing of grapefruit as well. Other light earthy flavors mix in as time goes on all while a little bit of caramel and orange that were present upfront fade. The grass that was in the nose also joins the scene, all with a bit of an increase in the hop. Toward the end, the fresh hop taste steps it up even more, giving a quite heave hop pellet like taste to linger on the tongue.Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation. For the mix of big fresh hop with crisp body, the middle of the road mouthfeel balances the two attributes rather well.Overall – A rather fresh, raw hop pellet tasting IPA. I like it, but in some ways a bit unbalanced with bitterness at the end. Certainly, a great brew, although I am not sure it deserves as much hype as it gets.",4.65
Focal Banger,Hell of a good tasting beer. I get some bitter citrus and a snappy hop bitter finish. Would not call it hazy by any standard based on taste. I’m drinking from the can as per instructions so can’t say anything about the look.Tasty beer but at a tough price point for my blood. Now and again if i see it…,4.79

I Let My Tape Rock,"BBA from Wakefest 2022Pours dark and fairly thick, minimal head. Has some coconut floaters. Massive chocolate aroma mixes with light coffee and sweet vanilla; coconut lingers on the finish. Flavor is molten chocolate espresso lava cake, chocolate covered coconut flakes, I get a little cherry cordials on the finish. Thick and creamy, yet there is a hint of lively carbonation. Overall an amazing beer, a year old and the coconut is still there.4/5/23Bomber4.5 rating",4.78

Bourbon Paradise,"1822Name: Bourbon ParadiseStyle: Barrel-Aged Imperial StuffLocation: Kreb, OklahomaABV: 13.7Date: 2022Continuing with stouts, I chose this from Prairie. Using my Jester tulip glass, I let the beer warm up to 56 degrees. A hard pour created a half finger, medium dark tan head. The retention is dismal, and dropped as fast as it formed. The color of the beer charts arounds SRM 36, dark brown with ruby hues. The beer is opaque but does show some carbonation bubbles on the sides of the glass. Overall the appearance is average for this style, I wanted to see a longer lasting head.Nosing the beer, I detect dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut with espresso. After smelling the beer several more times, I notice caramel, bourbon, oak, hints of floral, dates, raisins, slight char, roasted malts, bready, and a touch of Maillard.The chocolate weaves coconut with vanilla seamlessly. Other flavors in the beer are caramel, bready, roasted maltiness, raisins, figs, oak, bourbon, oak, anise, soy sauce, oranges, hints of floral, Maillard, and char.The heavy roasted malts gives the beer a heavy body and a low carbonation. A chewy thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish.The beer is tasty, yet I have a few complaints. I wanted more coconut flavors and less char. Overall the beer is a wonderful example of Imperial stout. I enjoyed sipping this one on a cold winter night.",4.46

I love it...one is enough due to its intensity and richness...A masterpiece...",4.5
Bourbon Paradise,"Poured from bottle to wine glass. Super dark color with rich brown head. Totally opaque, head is very small and is soon totally gone, there is some lacing however. Strong scents of soy sauce and dark malt, I like this though it is bordering on being too strong. Taste, there is a lot here. Extremely rich, strong flavors of raw coconut, bourbon, soy sauce, roasted malts, licorice. It is delicious but it is simply too much. The beer is creamy and the finish is incredibly long. A great beer but it is just not for me.",4.5

The Rusty Nail,"Poured from 22oz waxed bomber into a tulip. This is the 2023 vintage release; this version is 14.1%. I had this beer ages ago when it first came out, but I'm just getting around to reviewing it now!Appearance: dark as a moonless night with a starless sky. Impenetrable. Head is a thin layer of tan foam; that could be a little nicer.Smell: cinnamon right up front, but with enough vanilla from the bourbon and a dash of licorice to really give the feeling of a sweet bread. I mean, this thing is as sweet as summer days are long, but the overall vibe is ""great big hug from a panadería"" and I am very much into itTaste: sweet, of course, but with a very bakery-like sensibility, as in the aroma. The licorice and alcohol give the otherwise sweet cinnamon-roll flavor a more mature dimension. I really love the complexity of flavor and juxtaposition of elements here. It's diabetes in a bottle, but hey, I don't really need these feet!Mouthfeel: rich body with a good carbonation and a smooth, satisfying creaminess. Maybe not perfectly silky, but damn fine.Overall: the drinkability for a 14.1% BA stout is truly astounding. This beer is a sugar bomb; I'm really going to have some explaining to do after my next A1C evaluation. However, that doesn't mean this beer isn't goo-ooo-ood.",4.46
The Rusty Nail,"Yet another time to be alive pour, this one also came during the tap takeover for BeerNV right before the Alabama show at Lake Tahoe. This was the 2022 version.Pours black. Even though its the same color as a stout, I expected greater viscosity. Didn't amass much of a head. Some brown cherry cola like head but it was thin, 1/6"". Blew a hole down the middle. The aroma didn't yield much in the way of roasted malt, it put a much heavier influence on the barrel(s). Sweet bourbon and/or whiskey notes dominate.The taste gets a little more complex, perhaps its the stuff I loathe like licorice or cinnamon bark, actually making a yield that is more enjoyable than the sum of its parts. The mouth feel isn't hot or bitter like I was expecting, its a real smooth showcase for a pretty big beer, but it doesn't have that challenging edge that extreme advocate seems to desire.Its a pretty nice big beer and I don't like big beers that much lately.",5
The Rusty Nail,"I haven’t had a tetanus shot in a while, and the nail might be rusty, but I’m still going for it.

Starless and Bible black in color.The nose features the barrel and a wee bit of malty char. Pleasant but unremarkable.The taste reveals the licorice and cinnamon bark. They pair nicely and do not dominate as I feared. I'm wary of cinnamon in beer, but the deft hand of the brewers keeps things in harmony.Mouthfeel is luxurious and finish is barrel. Not too hot but the booze is felt. There’s enough carbonation to satisfy.",4.36

Sweet, complex, and balanced.The flavor follows the nose but is joined by a wave of chocolate covered cherries, plum torte, cloves, faint poblano, sweet hay, and more. Malty and rich with hints of toasted nuts and 'smores in addition to black licorice and cinnamon. Medium earthy finish with the base beer shining through like the best oatmeal cookie you've had. Hints of ceylon tea at times. Low bitterness throughout. Flavors are not quite integrated - curious how this would age.Slick, oily, full-bodied mouthfeel, low tannins, and lush carbonation. Well hidden ABV.For me this falls just a little short of perfection with the emphasis on spices and a finish that is just a tiny bit too sweet.",4.11
The Peach,"Never giving up on those childhood snacks de Garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey, earthy, tart and spicy wild ale. With lambic influences at the helm at well, this fruit rollup is corked, capped and ready for adulthood.Pale gold and lightly of chrome, the light and yeasty haze of The Peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam. Pulling from its white wine appearance, the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy, tangy, earthy, briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna. As its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue, the suggestions of communion wafer, sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start.As the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate, the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon, lime, white grape, crabapple, yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge. All the while, the peach character gives a melon-like roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste. Nearly apricot, mango and orange-like, the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant. Trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops, hints of grapefruit, grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate.Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the off-clean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine, saddle leather and oak tannin.",4.75
The Peach,"2022-12-25750ml capped/corked bottle served in a pair of little Cantillon stemmed glasses. Bottled 10/21.Pours clear, light golden, with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass. Smell is tart and funky. A bit of wood, some dry chardonnay. Something musty. Very interesting.Taste is dry, tart, very chardonnay buttery, peach / stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody / chardonnay notes. Tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons. Mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes I think.Mouthfeel is medium to light, super dry, slight filminess, gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity. Overall, it's good and very interesting.",4.34
The Peach,"Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch",4.61

Supplication,"Supplication (2023) from Russian River. 12.68 fl oz cork and cage bottle from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF #17. Reviewed 23/06/23 (Review 3127). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.Label stamped “BOTTLED ON 020823”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 49.8 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.9 degrees F.Appearance – 4.25First pour – Gold (SRM 5), clear.Body – Deep Gold (SRM 6), chill haze. Under direct light, opaque. When rear lite, chill haze.Head: Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), champagne, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.5 mm broken ring of bubbles with no cap.Lacing – None.Aroma – 4.5 – Weak cherries and oak. No yeast, no hops. No ethanol (7.75 % ABV according to the label).Flavor – 4.5 – Cherry, slightly sour with some tannin. No yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol flavor but pleasant gastric warming.Palate – 4.5 – Medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation.Final impression and summation: 4.5 Another excellent brew from RR. Their combo of pediococcus, lactobacillus, brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises, the tannin begins to dominate. Still, quite good!",4.31
Supplication,"375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 020823 (barrel aged 9 to 15 months, pinor noir barrels, with cherries). Served in my new stemless CBC glass. Brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation. Mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness. Flavor brings on a LOT of that tartness, approaching outright sour, but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the Brett nicely. Sharp carbonation is suitable here.If I was more into sours I might find this outstanding. I find it more drinkable than Cerise Cassée, and I really appreciate the balance here. Unfortunately for me it's a balance between sour Brett and sweet cherries, not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that I'd be more interested in.",4.42
Supplication,"This pours out copper, a bit of haze, minimal head and no lacing. Nose is a punchy vinegar note, wine barrel and fruit beneath. Flavor is a less aggressive presentation of the nose, with cherry and full red wine elements melding into the strong acidity. The wildness also comes through as a counter to the acidity, putting some earthiness and funk on the back end. Well built and delicious.",4.5
Supplication,I couldn't get into this one. The taste was all over the place and a bit too sour for my tastes. Carbonation and head was good. Sad because I really wanted to like this.,3.81
Supplication,Bottled in 2014 poured into a tulip glass. This beer has way too much going on. Almost like they tried to creat so many flavor profiles it ended up just tasting like a mess. Not very drinkable thus not very enjoyable.,4.54
Supplication,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way.Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.Overall, very interesting and very good beer.",4.69
Sip Of Sunshine,"Had on tap at 1914 house NiwotOn arrival nearly 2 fingers of bright white head sat on top of a clear, deep, but still pale, golden body. Sparse fine lacing is left.Aroma is floral, fruity, and piney, immediately with big hop notes, backed up by a nice soft sweet pale malt. Very appealing and comes off as refreshing.Taste is bitter, but less so than expected. The hops are piney, earthy, and slightly sweet and fruity, with a grapefruit pith bitterness in the finish that is again balanced by a mellow honey sweet pale malt. There is a definite citrus brightness but that isn't the main thing here.Feel is super drinkable and even dry. This is damn refreshing for the ABVOverall this is super solid, and in my opinion a benchmark of the ""modern"" WCIPA. Not a product of the IBU wars but still true to some of the original American hop flavors. Not a Juicy/hazy IPA.",4.48
Sip Of Sunshine,"I cannot believe that this beer is so highly rated. It is good, but far from world class.",4.25
Sip Of Sunshine,Poured from the pounder into a nonic pintA: relatively clear straw gold with a nice thick head that dissipates to a wispy collar and a few islands of thin clouds.S: Tropical fruit and some lemongrass hints. No strong malts to speak of.T: beautiful bitter notes of underripe stonefruit and pineapple.M: smooth and slick with a good bit of dryness then a slick finish.O: if I ever had a near 5ish this is it in IPAs,4.35

Sip Of Sunshine,"On tap.Bright, golden yellow with a brighter, white head of sticky foam.Good staying power and lacing.Aroma is clean and softly sweet, hints of lemon and sugar dusted pineapple, this beer smiles and invites you in politely.Flavor is balanced mix of lager-like malt and white pepper hop bite.Long and mellow hop character in balance with the mild sweet roll flavors and stewed fruit notes with just a hint of alcohol.Clean, balanced and well made is the best way to describe this very session-able but slightly boring big beer.",4.6
Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glassAppearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a moderate sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.Smell – The aroma is very strong of a sweet grapefruit and tangerine smell mixed with notes of papaya and some herb. There is also a rather strong peach and apricot smell, mixed with some lighter smells of pear and biscuit malt.Taste – The taste begins with a nice smooth tangerine and bready malt flavor mixed with the grapefruit hop that was in the nose. There is a touch of herbal and pine hop at the start as well, but these are very light in comparison to the grapefruit hop flavor. Other flavors of a light honeydew melon and a decent showing of mango and papaya are there as well, with the ladder fruit getting more intense as the taste advances. A light floral hop and a bit of grain develop at the very end, leaving one with a smooth and rather citrus strong taste to linger on the tongue.Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the lighter and thinner side for a 8 % abv brew, with a moderate carbonation. For the big citrus and fruit flavors the feel is quite nice, making for a nice and dangerously easy sipper.Overall – A very pleasant drinking, citrus forward, and highly flavorful IPA. A quite well crafted and very tasty brew.",4.07
Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, orange, pineapple and mixed tropical fruit and a little pine. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus, tropical fruit an piney hops, grapefruit and orange rind, pine needles, mild mixed tropical fruit and some dankness. A somewhat different piney and citrus rind flavor develops in the finish with great aggressive bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I guess with the market domination of hazy NE style IPAs out here in the West, I kinda thought the East Coast would be a wasteland of hazies. I've been lucky enough to get several fine IPAs from out East and I'm now convinced that good old non-hazies are available there too. This is a fine example. Not quite a West Coast profile, but lots of the citrus and pine I crave. Lots of herbal hop flavor. I am especially happy about the flavor change about mid-taste, where strong pine takes over from the citrus and fruit, but a somewhat different, mixed fruit note is revealed behind the almost resinous pine. Appropriately named,this is a bright, cheerful IPA I'd love to drink again.",4.29
Sip Of Sunshine,"Sorry to report, (because it will be even harder to snap up when it gets to local shelves) Sip of Sunshine is a great IPA, it is fkn delicious!",4.74
Keene Idea,"Old school piney crisp westie. Just a style that isn't brewed enough these days, and it's a real shame. Kick you in the teeth bitter - pours a delicious golden amber, and perfectly carbed. Very sippable. Not sure it lives up to the god-like status some hold it in, but it's a very solid west coast IPA.",4.01
Keene Idea,"Not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of ""it's an old style not fit for today's trends"".......it was brewed to be a piney, bitter, and malty beer and it's damn well crafted. If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. This beer is a fantastic brew, with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don't find with most beers made elsewhere. When you take a sip, you just know it is a well crafted, and balanced brew.",4.63
Keene Idea,"No. No, no, no. I can't understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status. It's fine, but the flavors, scent, and mouthfeel stop there. As a California born dude, I above all want to champion our beers. This is fine, but it's just not the champ.",4.71
Keene Idea,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net.Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beerCheers!",4
Keene Idea,"Pours golden in color with a nice head that leaves a beautiful lacing. The nose is slightly sweet, almost honey like hint but a bitterness added. Taste is bitter that quickly goes away with a dry finish. Superb beer.",4.25
Keene Idea,"Nearly clear amber brew with plenty of foam in the fat wheat beer glass. Lush with creamy carbonation. Malty and medium sweet. Aromatic with citrus and papaya. Taste is candied bitter orange, or marmalade. Very sippable and well made.Hops are listed at Citra, Southern Cross, Nelson, and Pacific Jade. This DIPA bears the extra alcohol and malt well. A little of a hop overdose as you might expect. I have not had an Alpine beer in years so was happy to try one I had not seen. Brewed in San Diego. From the 16 oz can dated 10/25/21.",4.17
Beatification,"Sent my way as return fire by @Beersnake1 during NBS BIF#16.Pours a pure golden yellow that's mostly clear, but I wouldn't describe as crisp. The colour, actually, isn't far off from a slightly lighter version of the label. Wet bubbles rise through the liquid, but there's no head, and thus nothing to retain nor leave lacing.Nose is bright and inviting. Starts off much more on the fruity side rather than the truly funky side (we're getting there, though, don't worry!) with some apple, and like meyer lemon. The apple transitions to a mustiness that gives rise to thoughts of wood, and carries us over to the earthier funkier side with light elements of barnyard and just a kind of tart element.Flavour is awash with an interesting lead in that I want to give credit again to that meyer lemon-type flavour, then bits of crabapple and wood giving way to the earthy funk again, which presents in a really interesting way that I can only think to describe as, 'open.' I don't know how that works, but where a lot of funky wild ales like this feel tight, compressed, bound up tartness, this feels like the pages spread wide and a more easygoing (but no less pronounced) welcoming earthy funk. The lemon and the funk kind of build together to a pinnacle about 2/3 of the way through that is more in the horse blanket realm and borders on harsh, though the rest of it feels aggressively tart, but in a welcoming manner. The back end takes elements from all of the above, along with a little bit of bleu cheese and faint honey to leave a tart dry finish.Very fine carbonation sits atop a decidedly funky/tart beer, but one that I wouldn't describe as sharp.I've had several in the -ation series, and they've all been top notch. This is no exception. Thanks, Tim for sending this along my direction!!",4.49
Beatification,"Bottled 4/3/20. Poured at 52°. Deep gold with excellent clarity; thin tight white head, poor cap retention leaves a small island of micro dots; brief thin ring, no lace. Mild funk, apples and oak nose. Tart green apple, pear; mild funky horse blanket; white grapes middle; oak; mild tart fruit on backend. Light body; moderate minus carbonation; crisp dry finish. Overall, the funk is mild; drinks like a lambic style minus the barnyard intensity; very approachable…a perfect gate-way beer for those not familiar with Belgian Lambics who want to dive in.",4.78
Beatification,"Had this on draft at a place with one of the early RRBC accounts in my area. It brought me back to my first pilgrimage to RRBC in Santa Rosa at the 4th Street location. I thought I was there for the IPAs but a family member ran into someone they knew with a goblet of another RRBC barrel-aged product who said ""I don't even like beer but I love this!"" I ordered my own goblets and was introduced to the loveliness of Sanctification and Consecration.So began my love affair with RRBC barrel-aged stuff. The 100th percentile score is well-earned. This is a delicious sour, which offers common ground to people who normally will not drink sours. The more sophisticated reviews for this will fill in all the notes of stonefruit and granny smith apple stuff that my review lacks; all I have to say is, in the same way that you could serve PtE to someone who would never touch a DIPA with a ten-foot pole, a goblet of this can evangelize regular folks with unsophisticated palates like mine to appreciate the wonder of wild ales and sours made by skilled people.",4.4
Beatification,"Soapy white head that leaves a bit of lacing in a mostly ser throw straw yellow body. Funky, gristy, tart whiskey and oak nose. Taste is grains and sour earthen grassy Granny Smith apple, funky, sweet, vinous. Medium mouthfeel and champagne bubble effervescent. Wow",4.54

Beatification,"Poured from 375mL bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. Bottled 1/25/22, so it's got a solid year under its belt.Appearance: lovely light-golden hue with a little tiny bit of haze and a finger of frothy white foam atop. Looks nice.Smell: soft malt with a light sourness and just enough sweetness to give a light, candylike aroma. Enticing indeed.Taste: tarter than the aroma would suggest, but with just enough sweetness to be balanced. The sour isn't super sharp, it has some softening around the edges. This is quite an enjoyable beer.Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a decent carbonation and a nice creaminess. It has both more body and less carbonation than I usually expect from a bottle-conditioned beer.Overall: this is certainly a very nice sour and I'm quite enjoying it. I'm glad to have finally tried it, and while my experience perhaps does not match the raves this beer receives on this site, I am in no way disappointed.",4.69

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 vintage; consumed on 5/22/2023Pours a jet-mahogany body topped with two fingers of fluffy, khaki-hued foam; good head retention leaves a spotty, paper-thin cap, large, creamy collar, and a modest array of chunky, webby lacing strewn around the walls of the glass.Aromas open to fresh prune laden with prickly oak as accents of fig wash through an encroaching bourbon undercurrent sporting progressive dark cocoa and edgy vanillins detailing.Taste brings saucy prune and stewed dates upfront, with notes of dusty cocoa and charry oak encroaching on Werthers Originals past the mid-palate into smoked toffee meeting distant undertones of burnt vanilla on the back end of the profile.Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body and a robust fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing an airy char to a steadily cleaning roast washing over the mid-palate, a quiet warmth trailing into a bright twang integrating effortlessly toward the finish.A daring fusion of barrel and brightness in a profile saturated with near-syrupy dark fruit reductions and a tempering, deft level of cocoa char; an exceedingly bold, almost authoritative expression of the style executed with adept clarity.",4.6
Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"1910Name: 4th DementiaBrewery: Kuhnhenn BrewingLocation: Warren MIStyle: Old AleABV: 13.5%Date: 2022Next on the review desk is Fourth Dementia from Kuhnhenn Brewing. I am going to start to pull some big ones from the cellar. This beer has been on my want list for over eight years. Many beers on my want list, like Fox Farms, require travel. I am excited to get to this review. Using a tulip, I served this beer at around 50 degrees. The pour created an airy, fingered light brown head with no retention. It came and went faster than life. No lacing was left on the glass. The high alcohol content could cause the head to wane. I was charting the color somewhere around SRM 32, dark rusty brown. The appearance is about average for this style.Nosing the glass, I smell whiskey, oak, caramel, toffee, chocolate, soy sauce, mild coffee, bread, raisins, smokiness, Maillard, vanilla, char, and tobacco.The first sip is like a perfectly executed tango on my palate with flavor. I taste whiskey, oak, caramel, toffee, chocolate, soy sauce, mild coffee, bready, raisins, figs, vanilla, Maillard, tobacco, char, dark roasted malts, burnt sugar, and an aged wine note.The mouthfeel is slightly warm and coating, finishing smooth and long.This beer is smacking. The wait was worth it; everything about this beer is terrific. The barrel age is near perfect. The warmer the beer gets, the more flavors develop, creating this symphony in your mouth. Stellar beer; I wish I had several more to sip on.",4.54
Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2022 vintageI knew downloading Tavour would be a good idea, and I am very grateful that it allows me to access this long time want of mine. I’ve only had one other Kuhnhenn beer before, the best in style Raspberry Eisbock that I enjoyed very much. This one is yet another highly regarded style topper. Let’s dig inPours an opaque dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacingWow, this is huge in the nose. Super malty and bourbon forward. I’m picking up on aromas of brown bread, toasted walnut, sweet bourbon, dates, smooth oak, sticky caramel, raisin, brown sugar, smoky tobacco, light aged hops, and sweet red wineIt doesn’t reach the same levels of intensity in taste, but it is still very good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting brown sugar, dark bread, raisin, black cherry, sweet bourbon, caramel, smooth oak, light vanilla, and old leather. The swallow brings notes of brown bread, molasses, toasted walnut, brown sugar, sweet bourbon, burnt caramel, toasted oak, port wine, smoky tobacco, and light sherryA medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes off dry with just a touch of booze, feeling well before 13.5%This is absolutely awesome!

We found that bottle aging for ten days smoothed it out.After a few years of substandard Citra hops resulting in a brew not as good as the first, it's back up to where it was in the beginning.Since KRBC switched to all aluminum cans, the mouth feel is less wonderful than from a bottle.It's best at the brewery.The food?I go to drink, not to eat.

Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 45.3 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F.Appearance – 4.25.First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), clear.Body – Pale Gold (SRM 4), hazy. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, translucent.Head: Large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive center pour), ivory, high density, average retention, rapidly retreating, leaving a 1.2 – 2.2 cm jagged crown and a rocky complete layer. As the head contracts, irregular elongated islands remain above the head.Lacing – Good – remnants of the head following the patterns of the head, but thinner.Aroma – 4.5 – Grapefruit and generic citrus (tending toward pineapple) backed by caramel malt, no yeast. No ethanol (8.5 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma.Flavor – 4.5 – Follows the nose. Begins and ends citrusy and full-bodied, a bit dank and resinous over caramel malt. No yeast or ethanol. Barely noticeable gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends crisp and dry with a little resin.Palate – 4.25 – Full; dry; lively carbonation.Final impression and summation: 4.5 Good DIPA – dank, crisp, and citrusy.",4.33
Citra,"The smell is just unreal and this one is not for a first time IPA drinker. What a treat, and I hope they continue to expand with their distribution. Very lucky to get a hold of this legendary beer. So many powerful tasting notes, and the sweetness at the end is done just right.",4.31

Citra,"Citra pours a slightly hazy, cloudy amber color with a big beautiful head. A sixteen ounce, canned 11/24/22 is very strong with the Citra aroma. Taste is powerful and good. Citra and Amarillo go together well in this brew. Fabulously smooth and not really bitter at all. Overall a fine Double IPA.",3.75
Citra,"Both @2beerdogs and @Beersnake1 sent me cans of this one related to the recent NBS BIF#16, so I guess the California contingent feels strongly that I should try it!!Beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. Soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles, it sticks to the glass as it recedes.Nose is a great showcase for citra hops, and that works for me, because citra is a great hop! There's some citrus, some pine, some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath.Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.This is just a phenomenal beer all around, and right up my alley. I love what I've tried from Kern River, and I can see why both Tim and Derek both independently thought I should try this beer. Thanks, fellas!!",4.44
Citra,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours an opaque yellow with fluffy white head. The nose is tropical fruit, pine needles, marmalade. The taste is incredible.

Aromas and flavors of huge passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, blueberry, tangerine, red grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, cracker, bread dough, light honey/toast, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good sized pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, woody, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body. Balanced creamy/grainy malts and sticky/resinous hops in the mouthfeel. Long resinous drying finish with mild astringency. Mild increasing warmth of 8.5%, a bit of hop burn. Super juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a good sized malt backbone. Top tier west coast style, aggressive yet smooth.",4.34
Citra,"Poured a golden amber color with a nice 1 inch head that left some lacing. Taste is exactly what I hoped for—loads of delicious, dank citra! Mouthfeel is nice; has some rich gravity to it.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,"Canned 12/2/22Consumed 12/26/22I was surprised to see that Trillium did a Xmas drop in the Chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers, so I grabbed some as soon as I could for my holiday week. I find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a DIPA. My pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs, but I need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. I am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. The Midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side, but I actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. The beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as I am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. The feel is full and smooth. Overall a great beer. I wish I had a fresh Zombie Dust to compare to see which would win for me.",4.02
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,"Nice light fluffy pale ale. I love this line of pale ales in general, with the DDH being the best variant. Maybe due to having the DDH version first, I really expected too much of this. Full disclosure, this is very good. One of the best pale ales I've had, and packed with a lot of flavor for a relatively smaller ABV, and I do love galaxy hops - but this doesn't stand up to the DDH Fort Point.",4.35

Good retention and thick lacing.Big pineapple aroma with tropical Starburst, dank jungle weed and mango beneath.Pineapple-forward taste as well, coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. There was fairly strong Playdoh in there at first, too; it might have been connected to the head, because it faded after the first few sips.Full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation.Lots of fantastic elements in this.

Like Sip and Double, the smell really pops right from the can and continues after the pour. No trouble picking up the dank tropical and herbal scent. Triple kicks off with spicy dank hops followed by ripe pineapple and grapefruit pith that ends with that wonderful resinous sticky finish.

Leaner,"Just starting off by saying this beer is just stupid good, now that I have that out the way I'll continue with more detail. The pour of the beer isn't anything overly special, typical golden orange color, rapidly fading white head. The smell of the beer has that fruity Casey-like funk going on which is expected. The taste is honestly one of the best tasting peach sours I've had. I was truly blown away by the sweet yet tart peach flavor they were able to get out of this, incredible! The feel is medium bodied, finished dry and tart. Overall just outstanding!",4.5
Leaner,"Had on tap. Bright yet somewhat pale yellow opaque body with a white head and trace amounts of lacing. Smell has big peach with effervescent bright oak, wild yeast, flowers and pollen aromas.

Medianoche - Coconut,"This is my first time ever having a stout from weldwerks, and it's my first medianoche (I don't even know if they make stouts that aren't in that 'series'). This is really quite good. I'm a coconut fiend, and this doesn't disappoint It's essentially liquid dessert - milk chocolate coconut. To me, it's sweet but not diabetic sweet. It's less sweet than Coconut Vibes (Shared, aka side project), but it's also less coconut forward. Coconut vibes is also liquid milk chocoluate coconut, but it has a noticeable coconut pop. This is so integrated that the coconut is integrated, but not popping. I'd prefer the popping, but this is way easier to drink than that. If I was only going to buy 1, I'd probably buy coconut vibes only because of that noticeable coconut pop. GOD i love coconut.",4.75
Medianoche - Coconut,"This one pours a fairly flat looking inky and gloopy looking black color, with no head or lacing.This smells like pure sugar, cheap melted chocolate milkshake, coconut syrup, and caramel.This is actually disgusting. This series used to be some of the best barrel aged stouts in the country, but Weldwerks has just gone off the deep end with these. It’s just tastes like sweet stout glue, basically – it’s basically liquified black sugar – it’s basically…you get it, right? It’s just way too sweet and cloying, with barely any barrel. There’s not even that much coconut, it’s just way too sweet of a base – just loads of cheap overbearing chocolate character.This is too thick, and not drinkable at all, with very little carbonation. There’s not much booziness, but that’s maybe the only single kind of good thing I can say about this.What happened to you, Weldwerks? Where did you go so wrong?",4.51
Medianoche - Coconut,"This was scrumptious - wow! So much coconut on the nose and palate, plus dark chocolate, nice roast, bourbon, decent sweetness without being cloying; very thicc mouthfeel, great barrel; roasty, coconut finish.",4.66
Sunday Brunch,12/8/2015,4.79
Sunday Brunch,"Appearance: Sunday Brunch pours a deep, dark brown color with a thick, creamy head that dissipates slowly.Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex, with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. There are also hints of toasted oak and a slight smokiness.Taste: The flavor is bold and intense, with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth. The dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are present as well, with a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness from the coffee. There is a slight smokiness in the aftertaste that lingers on the palate.Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is silky smooth, with a creamy texture that coats the tongue. The beer is medium-bodied and has a medium carbonation level, making it easy to drink.Overall Impressions: Kane Brewing Sunday Brunch is a complex and flavorful beer that is perfect for sipping on a lazy Sunday morning. The coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors combine perfectly to create a decadent and satisfying experience. The alcohol warmth is noticeable but not overpowering, making it a great choice for those who enjoy a bit of a kick with their morning coffee. The smoky finish is a nice touch, adding an unexpected depth to the flavor profile. Overall, this is a top-notch imperial porter that is well worth trying.",4.25
Sunday Brunch,"Deep, dark black. Head was not as dark as I guessed it would be, more of an off white color. Strangely the nose is cinnamon at first, but after first taste then the nose was more coffee. Taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish. Not bitter, all smooth!! Great Porter.",4.6

Let’s see what this one is all aboutPours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacingThere’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanillaThis one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougatA full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hellThere’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains",4.5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done.",4.5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!",3.9
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"I believe this was a 2018 bottle (4 years aged). Leaned towards a more licorice flavor. Didn’t pick up much bourbon. Solid beer/liquor drink (20% it’s hard to still consider this a beer). My guess is that perhaps it’s a little better if it were fresher, maybe 6-12mo age which is generally where I like my BA stouts.",4.6
Mexican Brunch,"Pours jet black like coffee without creamer. Little to no carbonation. Thin in appearance and feel. The smell is noticeable as soon as cracking the bottle. The taste follows the smell, sweet cinnamon and coffee dominate with subtle hints of chocolate. Maple is faint but adds a nice sweetness. Chiles almost non existent but that’s fine by me. Really enjoyable after dinner drink.",4.43
Mexican Brunch,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.",4.6
Mexican Brunch,"500 ml bottle poured into a tekuA- Black with a two finger mocha head.S- Chocolate, cinnamon, some maple, coffee, some chili pepper, very well balanced.T- Chocolate/fudge, coffee, maple syrup, some peppers, cinnamon, slightly earthy.M- Smooth, creamy, full body.O- A very well done and balanced molé stout. Easy to drink and a nice kick from the pepper even though it is on the more mild side.",4.44
Black Note Stout,"Recording my review from memory. I drank this last night but wasn't able to write it up.12oz bottle, my friend drank half and gifted the rest of the bottle for me. He had suggested that we drink it together but our schedules didn't match up and he wanted to crack it open. No bottling date. This is the 2017 vintage, so this beer is probably 5 1/2 to 6 years old!Look: Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with impressive carbonation for a six-year-old bourbon barrel-aged stout. There was a thin brownish-colored head that reduced to a wispy layer. The head regenerates temporarily after swirling the glass.Smell: Up front, the aromas on this beer (at least at this age) are all umami, all the time. It has that rich, interesting soy sauce note that is blended with dark chocolate and subtle dried fruit aromas. Secondary notes of vanilla and amaretto.Taste: I am really impressed that this beer has aged so well. I was expecting it to be dull and flat. But it is really smooth, rich, very flavorful. It's also really drinkable and there is basically no heat on the palate. The umami flavor is really nice and then the beer has a nice dark chocolate richness. The beer has subtle sweetness, and the finish is mildly bitter with nice roasted malt character. The amaretto note is also really nice.Feel: It's not thin and it's not especially thick either. It's somewhere in the middle, I would say that it is medium plus bodied. The mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation.Overall: It's very tasty and really enjoyable. I've never had this before. It would be nice to get a fresh batch of this beer and enjoy one every year to see how it develops over time.",4.6
Black Note Stout,"Amazing no adjunct barrel aged stout. Look is black onyx. Smell is bourbon, chocolate. Taste is chocolate bourbon goodness. This is a solid, old school legend.",4.5
Black Note Stout,"1829Name: Black Note StoutBrewery: Bell'sLocation: Comstock, MIStyle: Barrel-Aged Imperial StoutDate: 10/05/2017This beer has been on my wants for a long time, but I thought I would never get the chance to try it. I was sent this in a box by a fellow beer friend. Using a tulip glass, I served the beer at 52 degrees. The pour created a one in half finger length head with dismal retention. No lacing was left on the glass after the quick dissipation. Charting the color of the beer somewhere around SRM 34, dark brown, nearly black. The appearance is slightly above average, regardless of the head retention.Nosing the glass, I detected bourbon, oak, espresso, dark chocolate, cream, oats, raisins, molasses, caramel, toasted bread, dark roasted malts, a hint of char, and a notion of floral.Sipping the beer, I taste bourbon, oranges, oak, resin, molasses, milk chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, caramel, toffee, toasted bread crust, oats, a tinge of soy sauce, a hint of Maillard, and a little smoky char.The mouthfeel is thick and coated. The body is a medium plus, has low carbonation, and has a delicious finish.This beer held up beautifully. I am pleased to have the opportunity to quaff on this stout. Thank you kindly for allowing to have this chance to try a retired beer. Simply a fantastic beer!",4.58
Black Note Stout,"2016 vintageAnother BIF beer from @Eziel, and they only retired beer of the lot. This one was quite the highly regarded beer in its time, peaking at roughly #78 overall based on data from the wayback machine. Let's see if it can hold up to the barrel aged Stouts of todayPours an opaque medium brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacingMan this packs a boozy punch in the nose for a relatively low 11.2%. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, black cherry, plum, cocoa pwoder, fruity coffee, toasted oak, light tobacco, and vanillaIt's a bit less fruity and more malt-focused in taste, but still just as good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black cherry, cocoa powder, caramel, brown sugar, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, vanilla, and lightly burnt coffee. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, burnt coffee, charred oak, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, toasted hazelnut, and caramelA full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation from the booze, resulting in a rich beer. Finishes surprisingly dry, roasty and balanced by sweeter notes for a shockingly drinkable StoutDamn, I liked this one more than I had expected to. Even at 6 years old, this is really good. It's too bad they retired this one",4.75
Black Note Stout,"12oz bottle into a goblet. 2016 release, so 5 years old.Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body. Generous tan head shrinks to a ring and faint covering, impressive given the abv, and leaves streaks and spots of lacing.Aroma is wonderfully boozy with a lot of dried dark fruit.On tasting, so smooth. Boozy, nicely warms the back of the throat. The dried fruit notes add a hint of sweetness.The mouth is a bit thinner than you might think, but it still rolls around the tongue beautifully. Finish is a warming smooth booziness, with a faint sweet note.Overall, delightful sipper of a beer. Been after this one for a while, so thanks to the mighty Sabatinis in Exeter PA for releasing a case from the cellar.",4.53
Black Note Stout,"#87, good folly miss molly",4.27
Black Tuesday,"Well, this will definitely get you lit. If you want a clean, bourbon forward stout then look no further. The barrel is over the top but still under control, which makes for an exquisite tasting experience.",4.6
Black Tuesday,"Finally gotten my hands on a Black Tuesday. 2021 Version. 18.9% ABVPours out a very dark brown liquid with some translucence during the travel from the bottle to the glass. No foam whatsoever. No surprise there. There is a creamy appearance to it though. Like chocolate milk towards the center with more light penetration on the outer edges.Nose is straight up strong bourbon and oak against a huge roasted malt backdrop. Ethanol is defintely showing itself. Chocolate is prevalent here as well. Sweet confection, like a rich caramel, interacts with the chocolate and brightens it up.On the palate, we've got that huge bourbon for sure. Oak tannins are strong on this one. That chocolate shows up but gets overshadowed by both barrel influence and roasted malt. Some savory notes permeate this brew. This aspect always reminds me of well done street cart pretzels. On the back end there is a beautiful dark chocolate covered coffee bean note that lingers for quite some time.Mouthfeel brings heat not only from the ABV but the tannins as well. Hot and drying. Probably would be better off drinking this in the dead of winter, but alas, here I am in the dog days of summer.Overall, while I very much enjoyed this brew, the time its taken me to snag this bottle combined with the ever rising prices of, well everything, this one didn't quite live up to the reputation placed upon it. Perhaps I should have aged this one a little longer. Anyway, despite that, great brew, but other breweries do great things that are similar and less costly and even more available.",4.73
Black Tuesday,"2021 can stored in a cooler. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a fizzy, one finger light khaki head that quickly dissipates to sparse patches with slight lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, bourbon, dry caramel, chocolate; boozy. Flavor is bourbon, dark toasted malt, bakers chocolate, raisins, dry caramel, oaky vanilla and a touch of licorice. Hot boozy bourbon finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. I've tried a lot of bourbon barrel stouts in my day, and this is the most bourbon forward that I can remember; almost like a bourbon boilermaker that was extra heavy on the whiskey. Fortunately, there is a lot of flavor in the base too, with good chocolate and oak, some dark fruit and caramel that are more reminiscent of a blended strong ale. I was concerned with the fizzy pour, but despite the quick fade of the head, there is plenty of carbonation. There is a lot of intense flavor at the start of the taste, but the bourbon alcohol kicks in and dominates the finish; nice oak and bourbon in the lingering finish. The two years this can has on it has not seemed to mellow the flavor much (and if it has, glad I got an aged one). I expected a big, boozy stout and this delivered. It is a bit on the unbalanced side from the barrel effect, but enjoyable. I'm glad about the sensible 16oz. can over the traditional The Bruery 750s. Glad I had a chance to taste this classic.",4.25
Black Tuesday,"Poured at 54°. Black body with some ruby see-through and good clarity; light brown rocky head dissolved quickly leaving no cap retention, ring nor lace; thick legs sheet the glass on swirl. Nose is bourbon and black licorice; boozy hot retro nasal; molasses as beer warms. Bourbon and bittersweet dark chocolate entry; oaky vanilla; molasses middle; hot phenolic finish. Hot mouth warmth from 18.9% abv; alcohol bite on tip and sides of tongue; full, non adjuncty body; silky feel, light carbonation; barrel dry finish. Overall, you better like boozy (and I do); layers of base and barrel flavors which are well balanced all but for the alcohol which is hot; dry oaky linger; definitely a beer to be enjoyed one sip at a time.",4.7
Black Tuesday,"2014 Bruery Black Tuesday19.7%Seen these on shelves for $50 dollars and it honestly just tastes like Deths Tar just a bit thinner and a bit less sweety but more boozy even after 8+years .Poured out very light brown( i expected a darker and thicker pour for obvious reasons)and settles dark brown into glass. No head whatsoever. A lil bit of bubbles swimmin up like salmon .Tastes is dark chocolate, caramel , big dark fruit and heavily roasted malts with a harsh boozy finish. Nothing special.Way too boozy as well. I feel the burn in my stomach from each sip and it gotten bit overwhelming after 4 sips.Mouthfeel is too thin for the high abv in my opinion.Always wanted to try this one and very happy I did. To whoever sent me this one a million thanks cuz Much happier i didn't get suckered in to paying what those bastards are asking for these bottles .I'm not afan of The Bruery mainly cuz of the prices they charge( i get it gotta pay for barrel storage)and weird ass beers they make , but may buy one So Happens It's Tuesday once a year in pint can .Overall I can see why no ones gives a fuck about these guys anymore. This is nothing special compared to a lot of stuff on shelves now and tastes way too hot even after 8 years. Makes sense why most members of their beerclub have 750s spoiling in their cellars cuz this is hard to finish and can't imagine getting through half the bottle alone.Update : still have 1/3rd of the bottle in my fridge 3 days later cuz i didn't wanna drink anymore.The price they charge for these is a crime.Pro Tip: If you been wondering about this and don't wanna buy cuz of the price tag just buy a bottle of bourbon ... you'll be better off",4.5
Black Tuesday,"Sampled at Cigar City Brewing’s El Catador Club XV bottle share party.2021 vint. 750 ml bottle.Poured a hit into a logoed Cigar City taster’s glass.

Tounge tar. Rich as Musk. Low carb.Overall, Damn. I stood there and refilled my 4 ounce taster’s glass couple of times more and had to go sit down. Drink some agua.

Scaled Way Up,"No age on this one, filled in a growler on 3/12/20. I believe it's 3-4 weeks since brewing.Pours a nearly completely opaque golden yellow straw with a finger of creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. Big nose of mango, dried peach, candied ruby grapefruit, cara cara orange, slight bubblegum, pineapple, over-ripened apricot and Portuguese sweet bread. Just bursting with a sweet candied tropical fruit aroma, love it. Tons of flavor on first sip, all the notes of the nose melded together well with an addition of over-ripe papaya, slight dankness, honeydew melon and a little bit of pine resin. I'm so glad I got a 64oz growler of this one! So good! Wonderful soft, slightly resin-y medium body but I kinda wish it had just a tiny bit more fullness. Medium- bitterness, medium drying, medium- prickly carbonation.. Today was my first time on jury duty and I'm glad I stopped by Trillium for this one, I can't think of a better brew to relax with after a long day.",4.77

Alter Ego,"Poured with a crazy foamy head. Dark yellow color and opaque. A very unique nose, grassy and peppery. Less hoppy than most treehouse beers and malty sweet. Very soft feel. Overall a great beer and definitely a unique beer amongst Treehouse's hazy collection.",4.38
Alter Ego,"Alter Ego is an American Double IPA that boasts a complex hop profile, with notes of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit. The beer has a hazy, golden color and a medium body. The flavor is well-balanced, with a moderate bitterness that is countered by a subtle sweetness from the malt. The beer finishes dry, making it easy to drink and leaving you wanting another sip. Overall, Alter Ego is a tasty and well-crafted beer that drinks like a tree house session even though it clocks in at 6.8%!!!",4.33
Alter Ego,"16oz can courtesy of Roguer.Orange-honey color, I'd call it highly hazy or cloudy in appearance, but not truly opaque like some NEIPAs. Thick, creamy looking head, colored somewhere between off-white and beige. Lots of lace and sticky globs of foam adhered to the sides of my teku as said head dropped.Aroma is reminiscent of tropical fruits, melons, stonefruits and grapefruit. Big hoppy nose to this, in a way that straddles the NEIPA and WCIPA styles. Curious to see if the beer's hoppiness is as dramatic in the taste.Up front, it's actually a little less intense than I was expecting. It's definitely a fruit forward beer in terms of the flavor hitting the taste bud beachhead, but it's a bit more restrained. At the finish it is sharply bitter, almost grassy and quite dry. This sharp dryness seemed to mellow as it warmed a little after opening.Soft, slightly creamy mouth feel.I'm not sure this is my new favorite hazy, but it'd be in the conversation and I'd hit it regularly if it were local to me. Thanks for this, Andrew!",4.32
Miami Madness,"Cloudy orangey yellow body, white head. Smells and tastes exactly as expected but even more potent and balanced: absolutely huge guava, passion fruit and mango with cutting wheat and salt, backed by lemon, cracker and lactose. But here is the thing, I came in expecting this to be underwhelming, but the intensity and depth of the fruit flavor, then met with contrasting berliner backbone is impressive. Feel reflects with tart juice up front, dry and snappy wheat on the back end, lingering light sweet and salty textures is appreciated, though this is certainly a new world take",4.33
Miami Madness,"L: Hazy orange with a slight white head that disappears quicklyS: Guava, mango juice, and passion fruit in that orderT: Restrained fruit compared to what the nose let on.

Saint Lamvinus,"This was drank almost a week ago, at Vítor Claro's home - the winemaker from Portalegre, behind the Dominó and Claro & Ferreira brands.Trying to review this from the top of my mind.Poured from the bottle to a stemmed wine glass.A: The body is dark purple with a light purple, almost pinkish head. Created a generous foam quantity that lasted quite a while before jumping in.S: The aroma is actually perfect without any overpowering acidity. It's balanced as it is sweet, savory, and acidic to the right point. It's a great beer only by smelling it.T: It's the taste of heaven. I think that after Fou'Foune, this might be my favorite Cantillon beer. It's perfectly balanced with the sweet notes from the grain and the grapes embracing quite well the light fruitiness, and very light bitterness of aged hops combined with just the right amount of acidity incoming from Brettanomyces. It's really great with nothing to point to as a downside.M: Body has just the right feel, being light with the cool effervescence and silky tones from the sweetness you can find in this beer. Bitterness is low. Acidity is mild.O: As said before, this ranks at the top of my favorite beers. Unbelievably good.",4.62

I believe this beer poured near brilliantly clear, making its reddish-purple hue more vibrant and alluring, mwahaha... its slight phenolic note definitely hits first and firm, while its fruity flavors take a few moments to surface... the 'plum' flavor for me wasn't so much fresh fruit as it was a ghostly concentrate essence of floral fruity aromatics, lingering in the background... would love to try it again from a bottle (2039)",4.25

Stormaktsporter,"Närke Kaggen Stormakts Porter 2019Yields a night black color with a smaller mohagony colored head.The aromas lead with ground coffee, honey dipped milk chocolate and matured, spicy wood. There is a leathery quality in this, accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel.Mouthfeel on this is rich, heavier bodied with a well fitting, lower level of carbonation, which manages to unfold a late effervescence.Taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate, roasted espresso beans, dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey. Reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top, blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this, together with a lighter note of caramel and mansion dust. Finishes with a lingering herb dryness, blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this, intensified by the warming, spicy and gnarly oak of the beer.Fantastic, complex and intense with a great balance to it. This is as good as it gets regarding this style of beer with a beautiful, carefully way of crafting a complex, yet elegant beer.",4.76

Beyond Good And Evil,"L -- Jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. Hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a halfS -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stoutT -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot sideF -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expectedO -- One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging, and Hill Farmstead has it in spades. Very pricey @$25/17 oz, but it's worth it91/100",4.87

Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"750ml capped bottle into a BBT snifter. Shared with schen9303.Pours pitch black and dense. No head, no lace. Thick, oily, sticky legs. Nose is a boozy Rocky Road ice cream. Notes of fudge, chocolate, vanilla, and sweet cream. Some hazelnut and brown sugar as well. Pretty incredible how much it smells like the dessert. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and sweet cream. Hazelnut shell and ash. All the flavors are there but somehow this isn't too sweet. A touch of roasted malt and cocoa powder towards the end just to add a slight bitterness. Barrel throughout that becomes more prominent as this one warms. This is delicious! Body is medium with low carbonation. Smooth and somehow soft on the palate. Sticky and boozy going down with a long, lingering aftertaste. I'm usually a fan of heavier bodies but somehow this works perfectly.I'm a couple of years behind the hype here but these Angry Chair adjunct stouts have been incredible. The nose and flavors are perfect.",4.75

Chocolate Rain,"This one pours a surprisingly thin dark brown that emits a fair amount of light around its edges; brief, cola fizz with no head, retention, or lacing. Nose has a leathery, molasses and salty licorice Black Tuesday backbone melded with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Some vanilla and oak as well. Nothing overpowering, and all the aromas feel like they're integrated into the beer, rather than an adjunct or flavoring that's thrown in on top and feels ""artificial."" Taste follows - it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of Black Tuesday, but the cocoa additional doesn't tilt this sweet. Instead, it takes some of the rougher edges off BT while still maintaining an overall ""savory"" (or at least, no sweet) stout. Lots of alcohol, barrel, and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish. Plenty of heat as well, but again, not overpowering. I do find the feel a little thing (similar to Gray Monday), but not everything needs the chew of BCBS. I still prefer BT, but this is a fine variant.",4.26

Let’s dive into itPours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacingThe nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molassesWhereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramelA full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heatDamn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma.

Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Brief Review:O: ""Holy shit, this beer is good."" That was my first thought. I honestly didn't go into this with much expectation other than I knew I'd at leas like it since it's TG and a Sue beer. I didn't love PseudoSue, nor the Galaxy Dry-Hopped version. Thought they were just okay, and potentially over-hyped. Haven't had either in several years. But once I cracked this, I could tell right away it was special. Haze-bomb in the glass. Huge pineapple and mango aromas. Mouthfeel and finish is super rich and juicy. This is honestly up there with some of the Tree House hazy's I had back in the day. Also didn't know this was a Top 150 beer until I looked it up, and I have to say, it's deserves every ounce of the praise.Recommendation: A surprisingly great extra hoppy edition of the classic PseudoSue. This is by far the best in the line, must-try and not terribly hard to get either.",4.25

Like the Espresso variant, I am not overly impressed by the nose - some coffee, not much else.The flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee.

The local varieties have a creamier touchOverall...This is a sweet stout. I believe the time on this beer (holding it for science haha) has made this beer sweeter than the normal and a practice I would not do to this beer in the future, Still a well made beer but I like a little more balance of bitter.

Mild bitterness throughout, earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon.Slippery, almost oily mouth-feel, with some residual tannins.Forgot how good the base beer can be, and the coffee adds another layer of roast/fruit/bitterness without distracting from the character of the stout. Wonderful example of the style.",4.43

This is well done but I like the original best still",4.69
Parabajava,"2022 version poured cellar temp to a mug. Base Parabola has always been excellent. This coffee version is good, with a new profile to the base. Gone is the bright, complex, woody bourbon up front. That has been replaced with a milder, more chocolate front. The middle is “Parabola” in body and flavor. The coffee comes into play as a mouthfeel factor and an end-sip lingering dirty cup of Joe. It’s a decent coffee flavor. It’s slightly odd to me that it comes into focus so late in the flavor. No alcohol burn, and really not much warming as one might expect from this big ABV bomb. For my money, I’d stick with base Parabola or the Anniversary offerings.",4.51

Parabajava,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours jet black with a thin (half inch) layer of light brown head. Tiny bubbles rising throughout the glass. The nose is fantastic. Intense coffee, but a really nice coffee smell. Not cheap stale coffee grounds. This is a fresh coffee smell. I roast my own beans, and this is like dipping my nose in the beans a few hours after roasting. Lovely. Other smells of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, malts, burnt wood, and some brown sugar.The taste is absolutely insane. One of the best tastes from a coffee stout. Again, the coffee is front and center. A lovely fresh coffee taste. Not overly bitter at all. Dark chocolate, vanilla, marmalade, brown sugar, a touch of maple, walnuts, and salted caramel. The barrel comes through here for sure, but definitely complimentary rather than dominant.The mouthfeel is thick and robust. The alcohol is there on the swallow, but definitely doesn't drink like it's 13.8% ABV! Overall, one of the best coffee stouts I have ever had.",4.49

Pour issued a slight capper which receded into a persistent, gurgly ring at the fill line. Nose is of coffee right at the forefront, some nuances that might have me recalling oatmeal stouts (or caramel corn); no noticeable barrel burn. Taste is coffee-bitter, sweet, tangy, a titch of grapefruit-y hoppiness (should i gargle it?).

Notorious Triple IPA,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent.",4.59
Notorious Triple IPA,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behindAroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waftTaste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heatMouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heatOverall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended.",4.54

JJJuiceee Machine,"Pouring that ubiquitous Tree House turbid, hazy color (in this case orange), the creamy off white head coats the glass as you drink the beer?How do they do that EVERY SINGLE TIME? Anyway, the nose is a citrus juice lover’s delight, with slabs of mango, ripe oranges, and passion fruit assaulting your olfactory senses. Incredible.The taste is simply the nose on PED’s, with the mango leading the citrus deployment for the ripe orange and passion fruit flavor, yet allowing a nice sweet oat flavor to cover the flank.The mouthfeel is full, soft, and supple. It should be a felony to make an 8% ABV beer this drinkable, but it’s not surprising coming from the hazy masters.",4.9
Moment Of Clarity,Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with a finger and a half of tan head. The nose is ludicrously good - it smells like milk chocolate syrup poured over crushed bittersweet chocolate pieces! The flavor faithfully follows the nose.

Emperor Julius,"Serving: CanCanned: Aug-2-2023Consumed: Aug-15-2023That's what I'm talking about! After a couple TH beers that seemed noticeably different in overall profile than my memory of them, I was starting to get worried that either they had majorly tweaked something, my memory was failing, my senses were wonky, or (worst of all) that I had fallen prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift. But praise be! That doesn't seem to be the case. This bad boy is dead on.From the look to the aroma to the taste to the palate, the whole thing just pops and met my standard (unconscious audible groan/swearing) for being nigh-perfect. Solid representation of the style, to my tastes and noticeably a Tree House character. Can't do much better than that.The nose and flavor are big characterful mixes of sweet citrus, ripe mango with a dash of boozy citrus/lupuline oil aromatics. Like the oil that you can see spray off a twisted rind of the light is just right. The flavor is similar and has a nice bitter but not overly bitter, boozy but not too much finish to it that kind of dissolves into orange rind and makes it take all my concentration to not just plow through the glass. As it warms (and this one started out at cellar temp*) the perfumey/boozy character mentioned above melts into a creamy, sweet sort of character that really ties the whole beer together and sums up that classic estery, fruity, soft, juicy TH character. Simply excellent.Glad I have a couple more and many thanks, Minor God of Drunken Flannel, for peer pressuring me into buying it.4.25...4.5...4.75...4.75...4.75***- Actually, typing this out I realized this is the first of these recent Tree House beers that came out of my trusty beer fridge (48.5°) and not a normal fridge temps below 40. I think there well could be something to that and my last 3-4 seeming a little lackluster. Lesson to you kids out there that warmer is often better contrary to what Big Beer™ brainwashes us with.**- the last drink in the glass made me unconsciously curse out loud alone on my balcony. Better than the first sip, bumped overall up 0.25 points.",4.75
Emperor Julius,"A finger and a half worth of an airy yet fluffy bone white colored froth... Sid retention... Color is an opaque pale orange... Nose is much more muted than expected... Light orange juice and subtle tropical fruits... Flavor profile is completely inline with the nose... Feel is medium to full bodied... Rather sturdy and mostly sleek with a good bite... Reaaly good and rather unique, but didn't quite live up to the rather lofty expectations I had built up...",4.27
Emperor Julius,"Pours a turbid golden with off white head, great retention to be fair. Freshly squeezed Florida oranges straight off the tree. I find that Tree House beers don't always deliver on the hoppy aromatics but this one does somewhat. I get a lot of mango kind of in that Dole Tropical juice deliver, with some rind citrus on the finish. On subsequent sips, the rind and citrus which you could call dank is more pronounced and the tropicality has all but disappeared. It's sharp as @sabtos said. It's kind of boring after the first sip to be honest. And it lacks the balance that regular Julius has. This is fine.",4.24

Does not feel like an 11% ABV beer, yet you get the effects afterwards.F: Thick, smooth, and luscious.Overall: This is the best Imperial Stout that I've had and it's not even close. I first had this in 2021 during the warm weather months and it's truly better than even KBS.",4.69
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Very good head production, but retention is lacking, fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long. Body is a lovely obsidian hue, cola-like along the edges.Aroma is quite strong, prominently featuring the bourbon. Notes of bourbon mash, brown sugar, oak, leather, red grape, cherry, coconut, syrup.Flavor absolutely delivers on a classic, BCBS-like BBA imperial stout. Lots of bourbon, but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter, but not overly hoppy nor too roasty, coming across on the more restrained side of RIS. Toffee, ginger cookies, raisin, coffee, prune, bourbon, oak, leather, white pepper, blackstrap molasses.Exceptionally easy to sip, savor, and chew, despite the ABV and barrel influence. Does finish fairly hot on the back third, letting you know just how big it is.This is an excellent BA RIS, with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. It's supremely drinkable, and less rich than most others, without sacrificing flavor. That said, I personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity, perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness. I also favor AIS over RIS, which certainly influences my take on this one.",4.58
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Plead the 5th from Dark Horse Brewing. 12 oz can. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received from @Whyteboar in NBW BIF #16. Reviewed 05/12/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.Undated can. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 57.7 degrees.Appearance – 3.5.First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby, top edge olive.Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, high density with a few surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island.Lacing – None. Not much expected at 11% ABV.Aroma – 4.25 – Chocolate, weak char, and some hints of bourbon. No hops, no yeast.Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Bourbon not detected. Slight oakiness. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Moderate gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.Palate – 4 – Medium, dry side of creamy, soft but lively carbonation.Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Look unremarkable, pretty much like every other high ABV RIS or Impy stout. Aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have. Bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste. The taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes. As the temperature reaches the end, some bourbon notes finally appear. Overall, a good RIS that’s certainly more subtle than most.",4.1
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,I had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do. Definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges. Mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout. Quite nice.,4.43

Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,"12oz can courtesy of Dimidiata. Been sitting on it for a bit, and decided it would be an excellent Valentine for myself.Poured into a snifter, it was the color of the mood of Philadelphia Eagles fans right now. Virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. Not a great looking beer, but it's not surprising considering how strong it is.As expected, it smells like a big Stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels, with an unexpected touch of what smells like Graham crackers. Smells like a luscious dessert.Tastes like it smells, but better. It's not a subtle beer, but you don't drink beers like this for subtlety. The bourbon Barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined, and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that, unlike a lot of beers I've had with vanilla added to it. That Graham crackery thing I noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. I do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer, perhaps it's a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. It is utterly delicious, that's for sure.Fairly creamy mouth feel, body is somewhere between medium and full.This is a glorious dessert beer. Perhaps also my last from Modern Times. But, hey, they're going out on a high note with me. Thanks, Christine!",4.5

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2022 VersionPours out a very dark brown. On a straight pour, very little foam is agitated out.Nose is oak, roasted malt, and a peppery quality. Almost like rye spice. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that this was a rye barrel aged stout. Or perhaps even a rye based stout.On the taste, however, there is more of a story. Oak and bourbon come through first on the palate. Behind that is the roasted malt bringing a dark bread note and a beautiful dark chocolate the sings throughout. I picture an overdone rugelach with a dark chocolate filling in my minds eye with this brew. The only sweetness being from what little is in the dough and the mildly sweetened chocolate. While the oak shows up quickly, it dims down as the palate progresses, and the more subtle flavors appear. Like a tide retreating to show the rocks that sit beneath.Mouthfeel is fullbodied but not oily or cloying. It has heft, but not the residue that often accompanies. There is drying for sure, most likely due to ABV and barrel tannins. The carbonation is considerable too, for a stout at this percentage. Mild compared to most anything else, but surprising in this regard.Overall this is what I expected from Alesmith. A respectful, expert brew. The base brew is a hallmark; an example of how often ""less is more"". The barrel aging brings it up a notch while still maintaining that level of composure and elegance. I had no doubt that this would be a world-class offering.",4.29

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"The beer pours a nice brown head that dissipates fairly quickly while the beer itself is a dark chocolate black with a nice glossy sheen to it.The smell is absolutely delicious. The bourbon and coffee come out first and followed by a nice mild and soft vanilla alongside a bittersweet dark chocolate. There is a noticeable alcohol note that shines through but doesn't really hurt it that much.The taste is phenomenal! It has the same notes as the smell with a few additions. The oak note is more present in the taste and lasts through the whole thing. The bitter coffee note comes out first and the bourbon doesn't show up until towards the finish alongside the chocolate. There is also no alcohol notes.The feel is good. It has a very smooth body with a tingling feeling from the carbonation. It also packs quite a bit of heat for a barrel aged beer.Overall, this is a delicious beer worth getting and holding for a bit because it definitely tastes like it can develop a bit more fully than it has right now.",5

Subtle and balanced, like a hoppy pine tree accompanied by a well proportioned waft of citrus. A mango/orange backed by hopps smell to be exact.Taste: Incredibly smooth, no burn, not pungent but a well balanced bittersweet juice taste with a strong fruity citrus that ends quickly with a smooth slight lactose bitter finish.Tail end: It leaves you knowing you just sipped a top notch beer. Quite possibly one of the best New England India Pale Ales I have ever drank. Its orange juice water in terms of smoothness.After Taste: Almost non existent other then a slight citrus reminder that ends in a very calm cream ending.As someone who has drank multiple beers from Treehouse, micro projects to the ninth best beer on this website, I can see how this beer is rated as a 100 after almost 1,000 ratings.

I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, peppery hops, orange zest, resin, mango juice, and light gooseberryIt doesn’t quite have the same bite in taste, but I do like it quite a bit. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, white wine, gooseberry, bready malt, grassy hops, light caramel, pineapple juice, and cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, tangerine, gooseberry, light white wine, and overripe cantaloupeA medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and dry beer.

Blåbær Lambik,"Pours crystal clear, dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it? The short answer is probably no, but hell it was fun anyways.5/4.25/4.25/4.75/4.25",3.75

Looks still in the glass’s 4.25S: Aroma is immediate raspberries, hay and raw wheat. Initially quite floral which then cedes to funky notes of slightly pungent cheese. I can’t say that it smells particularly sour, but there’s some lactic tartness and citrus rind. Quite complex and a wonderful nose. 4.75T: Taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front, which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes, with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. Taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics. The raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent, not sure to what extent that’s due to the age. 4.5M/D: Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability. I could drink this all day. 5O: A wonderful beer no doubt. Not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as I think I prefer Cantillon Rose de Gabrinus when it comes to Raspberry lambics (and I’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years). Regardless, still wonderful and I would have a fridge full of this on the regular if it was readily available. 4.5",4.78

Framboos,"I picked this up last week at Vintage Estates wine and beer in Boardman OH. My favorite beer store. This 375 ml was very expensive but I have been after this beer for 15 years. Also got Hommage and may save that for beer rating/review #2k. Bottled on 18 Dec 2019.A- Body is a uniformly hazy orange with a hint of pink. Perhaps sunset in color. There is no head or lacing to speak of.S- The nose is complex yet simple. Tart raspberries, cheesecloth, funk, oak barrel, breadiness.T- The flavor is much like the nose- sweet and tart authentic raspberries upfront with a light bready yeast backbone. The finish is quite sour but a softness from the oak barrel lingers on with some sourness long after you swallow.F- Medium carbonation and a medium weight body. There is a lot of acidity in the body with a light bread yeast feel too.O- This beer is truly world class. It's the definition of a traditional fruit lambic and it is brewed so carefully and so well. It definitely gets better and you appreciate it more as it goes down. It's quite expensive so if you don't like more traditional sours or you don't like raspberries than don't bother.",4.21

Not quite as delicate as other fruited lambics. Drinks a bit fuller than the 5% ABV would suggest.",4.5
Framboos,"375 ml bottle (2018/2019 vintage) poured into a snifter. Pours a clear dark yellow/pink. Not much of a head or lacing. The bottom of the bottle contains lots of yeast/sediment which changes the appearance to turbid dark brown/red. Aroma features fresh raspberries and funk (leather, barnyard) with some oak and malt. Some green apple/lemon as well. Flavor is similar but with a malty sweetness that I can't quite describe; almost like someone added a shot of simple syrup. This detracts from the overall flavor profile. Moderate tartness. Moderate funk. Nice fruit. Overall it's solid but not something I'd feel the need to buy again. Maybe it's better with less time in the bottle, but then again, it does claim to have a 20-year drinking window.",5

Great,"12oz. Bottle served in a Spiegelau snifter. Vintage is probably circa 2014. Pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized apple cider (perhaps a hue darker). Not he, just a thin, broken band around the shoulders. Nose is robust - big hit of figs, followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidation/soy sauce in the background. Taste consistent with nose - figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile. Middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a still carbonation. Overall, a little past its prime. Not much of a suggestion of the barrel; however, still quite drinkable.",4.5
Great,"2013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge, with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style.",4.24

Art,"A: The decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact, which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. That luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue, as gamboge tones streak throughout. Proportionately, an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch, while steadily downsizing to the ½ in, where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. The configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling, when retreating to the ¼ in. At this point, a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick, as the retention retains an enacting solidity. Albeit, shy on the aesthetic decree, seeing the descending collar to the minute. The layouts have a transparency upon the transfers, which have an opulent appeal early on, while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiationsS: A density set to esters, as they constantly web around the oak casks, while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. There is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments, which takes a Torani Syrup form. In this respect, a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed, by the oak tannin exchanges, while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. The phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs, aside a ripened mustiness, given the vintage works over the decant. However, a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course, as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. The advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos, while maintaining a profitable presence on esters. Markedly, a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears, berries, and apricots. Moreover, an undercroft ease on the °F upticks, while a dry Torrontés similitude dispatches, besides the barrel aldehydes. The cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures, beyond the leathery tannin constitutesT: Fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness, which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. Namely, an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches, which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. The French oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers, where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. Meanwhile, malt backs the bready accounts with Dorset knobs & pie crusts, as hops back a longleaf pine essence, while ketones casually mingle. Chiefly, an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons, before connoting emerald drop pluots. A buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup, as catacomb dust delicately descends on Golden Silk Spiders. Coupled with, cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins, as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. The timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an Oloroso Sherry implementation, which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. On the rear side, a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg, while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke, as polyphenol compounds dictateM: There is a passing rain to flagstone texture, from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. The surface is soft with calm acidic natures, given the modest vivacities, which attenuate steadily. In consequence, a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures, when depicting the hydrolysable substancesO: Yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects, while phenolic companions lurk. On balance, a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course, as the French oak barrels impress. The timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness, from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters",5

I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, earthy bourbon, peat smoke, sea salt, cocoa powder, toasted hazelnut, dry oak, light vanilla, and raisinThe hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste, though they still aren’t exactly at the forefront. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, toasted oak, black cherry, burnt caramel, vanilla, sea salt, and smoky tobacco. The swallow brings notes of dark chocolate, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, sea salt, peat smoke, sea salt, molasses, dry oak, burnt caramel, and light vanillaA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv. Like literally less than half and that’s easily the most impressive part of this oneI struggle with this one. It’s definitely not top 250 material, and the adjunct isn’t really the star, but on the other hand it’s (dangerously) drinkable and pretty unique. Worth a shot for sure",4.75
Grey Monday,"750mL bottle, 2021 edition sent to new Society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. Very little difference from the base Black Tuesday, if I'm honest, having had regular BT many times but this being my first Grey Monday. That means it's excellent, but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent), yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. It's not Nutella, that's for sure. It also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard BT, being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high ABV and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit.",3.96
Grey Monday,"Pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges. Fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum, molasses, dark soy sauce, barley, oyster sauce, and vanilla. Flavor is a little tough to place. Heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. There's significant salinity that's different from Black Tuesday - less deep, blackstrap molasses, more brackish sea spray or even oysters. Malts, soy sauce, black licorice are there, but with less intensity than BT. The nuts come forward as it warms, and though it's hard to definitively place hazelnuts, they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. Mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (I'd call it ""moderate""), especially when compared to BT or a BCBS. That's not bad per se, but I think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. This was interesting - though I'm not sure I'd be keen to shell out for another bottle.",4.41
Grey Monday,"750 ml bottle, bottled 05/31/19, 19.2% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing, either. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, fudge, hazelnuts, brown sugar and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some burnt/charred malt, caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. It's a little more roasty/bitter tasting than I was expecting, but that's not a complaint by any means. All the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be. I thought this was a good overall imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you get the chance!",4.76

Grey Monday,"2018 VintageThe beer pours very little head and the beer itself is a dark brown color with a bourbon like appearance.The smell is good. It has a nice mix of a sweet alcohol note and sweet hazelnut.The taste still has the hazelnut note but the chocolate is more forward and dominates the taste alongside the alcohol note.The feel is good. It has a heavy body with very little carbonation and a slight burn at the end.Overall, a good beer worth getting and drinking fresh instead of holding it for a while.",4.5
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Pale, yellow, thick and juicy looking, so hazy, you can’t see through it! Topped with one finger of fast dissipating, white head. The smell is of orange, citrus, a hint of pine. Certainly not as pronounced as I was expecting. The taste is very fruity and juicy, like a perfect refined, orange juice, with a hint of dank Ness, and an abundance of tropical notes but all very muted. Light and foamy, feeling body, very smooth! I’ve been anticipating this brew for a long time I got it at beer hub in Waynesville North Carolina and I’m drinking in Maggie Valley August 12, 2023. I must admit the hype around this set my expectations quite high, and it is a great beer. However, not nearly as perfect as I was expecting. But certainly worth searching out.",4.83
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Poured the requisite opaque yellow orange with a growing manilla colored head. No floaties to be seen.The aroma is lost on my Covid damaged nose. Stupid Covid.The taste was a tale of two beers- at first it was magnificent with citrus notes and a hint of piney pith. I’m thinking this is awesome!Then I let it warm up a bit and it shifted to a dryer, more pithy taste. No idea why, it was still really good, just not magnificent.The feel is solid, smooth and no chunks of anything. Easy quaffing.OA, good, nay, great DIPA and I may get more. Or I might just stick with regular King Sue.",4.19
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Draught pour at Champps Americana in Brookfield, WI. This was a bit of a letdown - a solid (D)NEIPA for sure, but it is VERY green, not quite vegetal but definitely not an improvement over the original.

Great carbonation launching a good fullness.Overall...This beer I tried today for the 4th time is one of the elite beers i get to try. Sometimes a beer just hits you and says WOW and this for me has that quality. King Sue its close cousin I felt the first time i had that too!! If you see this beer and like unfiltered DIPas you would be a fool not to pick this up. I saw in one of the other reviews had this at 25 before tax and deposit and that is steep but damn this beer is nice .

Montmorency Vs Balaton,Latest batch.,4.9
Montmorency Vs Balaton,"This is one of the best beers on the planet. My favorite beer is Lou Pepe Kriek, and while of course nothing can replace LPK, this is as close as you’ll find anywhere outside of Brussels.In the spirit of BA I’m tempted to use a bunch of pretentious adjectives to describe its color, flavor, mouthfeel, etc., but the truth is you really don’t any of that. Just find it.",4
Montmorency Vs Balaton,This is an excellent Christmas Eve beer. First it has a great color for Christmas and the cherry and warm spice taste is perfect for the holiday.Bought the bottle of this during the pandemic when it was made possible to order and pick up. This beer pours a beautiful reddish purple color with a nice effervescent white head and excellent initial curtain lacing. Intense tart cherry smell and taste with warm spice flavors and a nice earthy funk. Enjoyed it very much!Had the latest batch on 6/5/22 from tap at the brewery. The latest version lives up to previous. Detected a bit of rich vanilla as well. Really a great beer.,4.46
Montmorency Vs Balaton,"A: pours up a murky reddish grape hue, with a quickly receding, white, one finger head.S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal.T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins.M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.",4.05

Orviamo,"750ml bottle. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass.Pours a dark reddish-brown body, one finger white head, good retention, not much lacing or film. Smells of jammy raspberry and a touch of stonefruit, a bit of funk, a bit of dark fruit and a bit of oak. This is the stuff of dreams. Big fruit presence with a complex barrel presence- that's what an AWA is supposed to be, right? Flavour is very similar; tons of jammy raspberry. Some stone fruited plum. Bright vibrant fruit sweetness intermingles in with dark fruit and the parent spirits. A bit of warming heat on the end, not unlike whiskey served neat. Mild fruity funk, but overall the fruit is the star of the show. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, soft and perfectly carbonated, and you get very little hint of the 10% ABV aside from the warming feeling as it goes down. Superb, very complex. Overall, another wonderful, heavy fruit jammed acetic wild from two of the best brewers in the US doing this type of wild ale. It's quite balanced! Nowhere near as sour as everyone has made it out to be, even more fruit than expected, and that's saying a lot.",4
Orviamo,"750ml bottle, poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass. Generously shared by Erik, enjoyed on 1.16.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.The beer pours a deep maroon color, hues of burgundy and crimson, hazy and cloudy with a bone colored head, about a finger high that has good retention and lace. The aroma is very intense and very complex, all of the barrels are immediately present. Very fruity, loads of raspberry, prunes and very cherry forward, strong port wine, tannic, acidic, vinous, very rich, very deep with soft oak, a bit of vinegar and some potent booze character. The flavors offer a bit more in terms of balance and lets each element breathe. Still, the various barrels are front and center, loads of port wine, vinous red wine and rich and oaky bourbon with a fantastic helping of raspberry and plum, more plum than the nose suggested, delicate and tart with some light vinegar and some warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice, coating, lively, almost juicy at times with a medium body and a crisp finish.Verdict: A very intense Wild Ale from Side Project and De Garde, perhaps too much at once. Rich, complex with great depth, but at times, the balance is lacking and the 10% ABV is very apparent.",4.75

Canuckley,"2022 vintageI picked this one up on a whim on Tavour just because I’m a sucker for maple syrup in a Stout, but little did I know that this is a highly acclaimed take on the style. I’ve heard good things about Transient bu haven’t has them until now. Let’s pop thid guy open see what it’s all aboutPours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of dense dark tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacingThe maple honestly isn’t even the first thing that jumps out at me in the nose, opting for a thinner maple profile to support the other adjuncts. I’m picming up on aromas of dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, milk chocolate, maple sap, burnt caramel, molasses, charred oak, and light vanillaIt’s also not extremely maple in taste, but it is unfortunately a bit sweeter than the nose led me to believe. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting burnt caramel, dark roast coffee, black cherry, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, toasted oak, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, raisin, vanilla, toasted oak, and sweet bourbonA medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky but drinks remarkably below its abvWhile it is quite sweet, it’s damn good and way too easy to drink for being 14.5%",4.4

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"This is probably the first beer I'm reviewing that you could consider a holy elixir, as Abbaye de Brogne is a brewery located in an abbey in Belgium since St. Peter appeared to Gérard de Brogne, a nobleman who lived around 20 km or so away from the abbey, and instructed the knight to build an abbey to honor God.That story, allegedly, took place somewhere around 880 AD, making this a very old abbey indeed.But in 2013, Belgian brewmaster Bruno Deghorain, along with his business partner, Gaby Smet conceived a plan to set up a small brewery in the abbey, with the intent to make abbey style Belgian ales like they did in the days of yore.This beer, Trappistes Rochefort 10, is part of that dream.Is it any good? Is this a holy beer?Let's find out!CLASSIFICATION:It's an ale, and when it comes to Belgian beers, there's a few styles.Here we're enjoying a Belgian Quad, which are rich, strong ales with bold flavors. Typically, they're quite dark in color, hovering around deep ruby reds and browns with garnet hues.In terms of taste, they're very sweet on the palate, low bitterness, but packing an ABV that will getcha there.When it comes to beer, Belgian Quads are some of my favorite beers next to stouts.COLOR:Caramel, a deep caramel almost as if you left it on the burner a bit too long and it got dark brown. Nice hefty butterscotch colored head that lingers for a long time.AROMA:Very malty on the nose, which is the dominant smell that I'm getting. A little bit in the background is a faint hint of milk chocolate. Little bit of caramel and brown sugar.BODY & PALATE:Malt and caramel on the palate. There's a faint spritz of clove that I taste. Little bit of a fruity taste that comes in, almost like wine in a sense. I do want to stress it's quite mild in that fruity taste, which I guess is that faint hint of citrus that I'm attributing to these particular kind of hops that they use.In terms of mouthfeel, it's pretty dense, almost like Coca-Cola in that sense. Very smooth, even for the ABV of 11.6% and fizziness of the beer.FINISH:It ends on a Belgian, malty dark chocolate sorta finish. This beer lives and dies by its malt character.CONCLUSION:This is a heavy beer that's akin to snuggling up in your favorite blanket and bunny slippers and sitting by the fire. It lives and dies by its rich malty flavor that hangs around.I definitely do not recommend this beer for a refreshing drink. This is more of an experience, a beer you savor.As far as holy, well, I'll leave that judgment to those more suited to make that call, as I'm not particularly religious.But, I bet if Jesus had a signature beer, I bet this would be his beer of choice.As far as myself, this has shot up to one of my favorite beers of all time, and this brewery became one of my favorite breweries of all time. They're a gem. Only issue though is availability and price. If you can find it, they are pricey, so if you're after a nice beer on a budget, might want to look elsewhere.But, you definitely get what you pay for, this beer is wonderful!Until next time...Cheers!",5
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a clear, brown color. Big caramel head formation with good retention. Malty, chocolate on the nose. Caramel taste, mild warmth. Smooth mouthfeel especially for the abv. A delicious classic beer!",4.87
Trappistes Rochefort 10,One of the best dark beers out there!,4.05
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Smell of caramel and brown sugar. Taste that follows just as promised with a well-carbonated and spritzy body of brown sugar, caramel, some clove. A great quad",4.25
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a translucent rich brown with a fizzy, cola head that settles to a thick 0.5"" coaster with very good retention and lacing. Nose is baked brown bread, prune, raisin, date, baking spice, hop spice, light alcohol, cinnamon, fruit cake. Taste has moderate, booze-soaked fruit sweetness, treacle, spiced red wine. Spiced hop on the finish, with a lingering sweet booziness. Mouthfeel has moderate weight and light, fizzy carbonation. Far more mild than Westy 12 in terms of its fruity booziness, with much more spice and hop character.",4.65
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Apparently this is one of the best beers in the world...so reviewing again. Many think that it is better than Westerveleren 12.Aroma is nothing special, similar to a canned Pelforth Brune. Lots of large bubbles, not as beautiful as Westerverelen or a Guinness. And definitely not a Chouffee IPA or Duvel Tripel Hop. But as the froth reduces, it improves.The best thing about this beer is the hop aftertaste. It's one of the best mouthfeels of any beer. Really amazing. But it doesn't compare with a Chouffe IPA in terms of flavour for me.",4.84
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Allowed to acclimate to 50°F (a little too cold, but I let it warm more) and poured into a Chimay goblet.Pours a hazy carob brown with lighter sediment floating around and a tan quickly dissipating tan head (forgot to pay attention to how tall).Initial aroma is a slight smell of high alcohol, with a hefty dose of yeast and malt, slight notes of milk/semisweet chocolate wafted around before I smelled it directly. Returning for a second round of smelling I notice a slight note of grass. A third round reminding me of a general whiskey smell.Initial taste is again, alcohol, followed by malt, followed by milk/semisweet chocolate, followed by light alcohol burn all over the tongue but concentrated in the middle. Third and fourth sips yield raisin and/or generic dark dried fruit notes upfront, as well as revealing a sweetness, similar to the natural sweetness of dried fruit. Sipping after that uncovered a spiciness that comes before the sweetness, combined with the warmth from the alcohol it feels very sensible. I have to admit that for me personally it becomes harder to drink as it warms more because I have a hard time with spirits, and the alcohol in this one is not hidden, but it's still got fantastic flavor.Mouthfeel is smooth, although a little thin, and the carbonation disappears.It tastes like a fireplace, super cozy and tastes like home kind of beer. This is the perfect beer to drink while wearing a cotton sweater by a fireplace or a library or den.It's expensive but it can be justified because it's excellent and has a high ABV. Will absolutely be purchasing again, as well as recommending and purchasing the others in the line.",4.4
Trappistes Rochefort 10,One of the very best in the world! Outstanding! one of the best and likely the best Monastic Belgium Triple. It's been around for several hundred years. But it's not for the faint of heart. A serious amount of alcohol here and does not go good with anything but monk bread. But a perfect beer if love a great ale made the old way on open vats or a monk sworn to celibacy,4.59

Impermanence,"Impermanence has a deep, rich, and opaque black color. It has a creamy, dense, and long-lasting head of tan foam that leaves attractive lacing on the glass. Impermanence is rich and complex, with a strong presence of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of dark fruit. The coffee notes are bold and robust, chocolate adds a smooth sweetness that balances out the bitterness from the roasted malts. The dark fruit notes are subtle, but add an extra layer of depth and complexity to the aroma. Overall, the aroma of the Impermanence Stout is truly captivating and leaves you eager to take a sip. On the palate, Impermanence has a rich, full-bodied flavor profile that is both complex and satisfying. The initial taste is a strong, bitter espresso-like flavor, which is quickly followed by notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt. This is balanced out by a hint of sweetness from the malt. Impermanence has a creamy and silky mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink. The texture is thick and smooth, coating the palate. The body is medium to full, providing a substantial and satisfying experience with each sip. The carbonation is low, giving the stout a smooth and creamy finish without being too fizzy. Overall, the mouthfeel of this stout is well-balanced and luxurious. Overall, Tree House Brewing Impermanence is an outstanding stout! With its rich flavor, smooth finish, and attractive appearance, it is sure to be a hit with anyone who tries it.",4.27

Let’s crack it open and see how they differPours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacingThe nose is very sweet and maple-forward, but there’s a delicate balance from the roast. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple syrup, vanilla, milk chocolate truffle, caramel, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light nougatOnce again in taste, there’s a lot of maple, but the balance is even more amazing here. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, toasted oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light coconut, and dark caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweet maple, chocolate fudge, dark caramel, toasted oak, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light molassesA medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a creamy but not syrupy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but not overly sweetIn a word; wow. Maybe I’m a sucker for maple in Stouts, 2 of my all time top 10 beers are just that, but this is truly awesome. Even better than Moment Of Clarity. Tree House strikes again with this long time want of mine",4.23
BDCS,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz can poured into my snifter, vintage 2022 but no other date stamp on the label. Received in a trade courtesy of @russpowell. thank you!the beer pours a rich dark coffee brown color and no light passes through my glass when I hold it to a light source.A dense creamy head of 1 cm of tan foam rises up from the pour and quickly fades to a sturdy edge layer that sticks around throughout my sampling. There are also a few small islands spinning in the center of the glass. Also get some scattered lacing when I swirl the glass or take a sip.Aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note. No warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon. Also no hop presence here at all on the nose.First sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation. The carb is very fine and gentle, which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience.Flavor is what the nose advertises, with sweet chocolate, brown sugar and some vanilla, all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow. Bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips. I do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too. Again, no hops to be found.Quite a nice imperial milk stout, one that I would gladly drink again.",4.5
BDCS,"12oz can courtesy of Russpowell. 2022 vintage. 10.3% abv, 69 IBUs (whatever they mean, anymore) per UT.Poured into a snifter, this was an inky black, with no interest in becoming any lighter even when held up to light. Modest, half inch of khaki-mocha colored head. Sparse, spotty lacing.Bourbon up front in the nose, along with milk chocolate and coffee notes, pretty much in that order.More complex in the taste than in the nose. Still bourbon-y up front, and with a milk chocolatey sweetness, but there's also a bit of tobacco and dark fruit to the flavor. It all melds together very, very well.Body is a little bit lighter than I expected, but not to a deal-breaking extent. Mouth feel is fairly creamy.This is a very nice BBA stout, one that hit the spot after dinner tonight. Earlier this week I found out for certain that my Mom does not have stomach cancer, as was feared for a time. I decided to drink this beer today to celebrate that fact, and I don't think I mis-chose at all. I would happily drink this beer again as a dessert or nightcap. Thanks, Russ!",4.68
BDCS,"Opaque dark brown body; thick, creamy, light tan head. Milk chocolate and vanilla tones on the nose. Incredibly smooth and complex flavors; milk chocolate; very subtle sense of whiskey; vanilla; light cinnamon spiciness; light bitterness peeking below the overall sweetness. Heavy body; dense and silky on the palate; very muted boozy warmth.This is just an awesome barrel aged imperial stout - a double cream stout per the notes. The base beer really shines while the barrel aging amplifies but doesn't overpower the beer. Depth and complexity are rife with this beer.

Is initially sweet but quickly replaced with the bourbon.Mouthfeel is oily smooth with a little carbonation and boozy alcohol warmth.Dangerously easy to drink for a 10.2% AVB BA Stout.I’m fortunate to live close, so I’ll be stocking up for the long year in-between releases.",4.39

The underlying stout is quite nice and the bourbon barrels provide a lovely depth and complexity. feel is medium to full bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation.Overall it's a lovely, well crafted bourbon barrel aged stout. Always a pleasure to drink.",4.57
BDCS,"Pours onyx black with just a smidge of dark mahogany brown on the edges and a dense, creamy tan head. Absolutely gorgeous beer. The nose is fudgy milk chocolate, bourbon from the barrel, vanilla, and oak - and the slightest bit of stone fruit (dark cherry).O. M. G.The taste is as described on Ozark’s website - a bourbon soaked brownie, with the added caveat of dark cherry flavor that works spectacularly well with the fudge and bourbon barrel flavors. This is frighteningly easy to drink for a 10.2% ABV BA stout.The mouthfeel is rich, decadent, and creamy. Simply delightful. One thing to note - one of the cofounders worked for Goose Island, and brewed that brewery’s BCBS.He apparently learned a lot, because this beer takes the best of BCBS and cranks up the drinkability quotient. This is the best beer I’ve had in 2022, and may be a Top 10 overall beer for me.That’s right, I typed that.",4.5

BDCS,"Bringing a little heat to the party, Ozark Beer allows for an extended aged Imperial Stout to bring all the bourbony warmth that would ever want to be inside of a beer.Dark and tawny garnet brown, BDCS '22 hits the glass with an ominous looking pour with a dainty trickle of foam for decoration. As a bourbon laced scent of dark roast coffee, caramel, maple, chocolate and toasted nuttiness lays across the nose, the flavors open up with a sweet heat of coconut, chocolate, molasses, vanilla and caramel.As the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze, the flavors of espresso sets in with baker's chocolate, roasted walnut and campfire to follow. Interrupted by the barrel, the flavors soon dominate with the strong oaken, toasted wood, weathered barrel influence with savory heat and bitter spices to close.Full bodied, full flavored and laying on the tongue with a heated glaze, the stout finishes both hot and sweet with a linger of savory heat in a long lasting afterglow.",4.4
Pseudo Sue,"12 ounce can poured into a shaker pint.Canned 8/28/23L: Opaque orange-yellow, large persistent stark white head, lots of sticky lace.S: Citrus and tropical hop aromas.T: Hoppy, pithy with assertive citrus peel bitterness, low sweetness.F: Medium-weight creamy body, highly carbonated, prickly feel,O: Good APA, cumulative hop prickle keeps it from being more drinkable.",4.91
Pseudo Sue,"This pale ale reminds me very much of Zombie Dust. I had it on draft and it was obviously fresh so I shouldn't compare them but damn, this was seriously a world class pale ale. Plenty of balance with the hops and malt and plenty of fruit flavors up front. I'll be headed back to that restaurant again just for another one of these on draft. Ive never seen it before in my area but I highly recommend it.",4.74

Pseudo Sue,"Poured from the 16oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a bright hazy orange color, murky and opaque, topped with a 2 finger fizzy off-white head. I am thinking I will need to fight comparisons to King Sue, but for the appearance, it isn't as ""milky"" as I would have described the other beer. It is a little duller. It looks like a very hazy IPA.Smell is very strong and refreshing and apparent from some distance away, even when just opening the can. Quite tropical. Orange and citrus rind. Grapefruit juice. Pineapple, mango. Balance upon further inspection in some bready malt within. Some piney hop in the mix, but not as much as advertised or described by other reviewers, in my opinion.Taste has a bit more of the pine notes, but it also more balanced with a more malty character than anticipated. Biscuit. Honey. It is lacking some of the heat I perceived in King Sue, but that is a good thing. Smooth. Fruit again is tropical with a lot more orange and mango. Tropical notes throughout, but balanced with a dryness. Finishes with a touch of pine.Drinkable. Accessible. This is possibly a gateway beer that I would introduce others to craft with. But that being said, it is far from bland. In many ways, this is what I want most hazy IPAs to be. Balanced, refreshing, tropical, flavorful. Even (almost) sessionable. I wouldn't call it ""exciting"" (some of the best beers are not) but I would call it world-class for the style. Does exactly what you want.",4.5

Abrasive Ale,"I am so happy to have finally found this locally (PA) after searching for it for years. It did not disappoint. While the can is over a couple of months old, the ale still tasted very fresh. I rate it as having a NE flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. It is translucent and golden, but definitely not cloudy. The head was white and not too foamy. The aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. The flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. What a fantastic drinking experience. The only downside was the $5 price tag, but that would be a bargain in a tavern.",4.5
Abrasive Ale,"Canned 11/7/22 (1 month ago)Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00)Aroma: Strong aromas of rich grapefruit, tropical mango and melon. Resinous, earthy, and tropical. Some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25)Flavor: Flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit, pineaple, mango/melon with a sweet peach undertone. A moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes. (4.25)Feel: Heavier bodied, strong carbonation and finishes sweet, but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate. (4.25)Compared to Revolution Anti-Hero IPA 12/2022: Pours lighter, stronger aromas. More juicy grapefruit, tropical pineapple, melon, and peaches. Less resinous nectarine and syrup. Juicier, but also more balanced with pine bitterness. Winner: SurlyCompared to Surly Axe Man 2/2023: Pours darker, hazier. Stronger aromas. More sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. Less dank berry and pine notes.Overall: Wow a surprisingly fantastic IPA here. Grapefruit, tropical pineapple, mango/melon, and peach flavors. Juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance. Beldns NEIPA juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. Sort of reminds me of Half Acres IPA blends and not unlike Axe Man in many ways. (Rating: 4.24)",4.79
Abrasive Ale,"Review 1713Abrasive AleSurly BrewingImperial IPADate: 17 Dec 2021Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent.Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal.Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank.The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers.This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.",4.41

Nicely tart and well balanced. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting passion fruit, underripe mango, lemon juice, apricot gummy, straw, apple cider vinegar, dragonfruit, and tart cherry.

Susan,"Golden amber with a modest and enduring off-white head, a full clear pint glass full just spilled out of a tap head. As with many hazies, this doesn't punch the nose, but it is pleasant. There's a pleasant starchy backing for resinous hops, which aren't at all that bitter to smell. There's a near perfect softness to the mouthfeel, just like a hazy styled AIPA should provide. Unlike too many others, it's neither too thin, nor too sticky. The same goes for the hopping. It, too, is close to perfect for the style. It's vaguely resinous, with a hint of a spice like lemongrass, coriander or pepper. With some nice glass lacing, this also looks close to perfect. Overall, this is one incredibly good beer. Outside of New England, this is a rare find. When it shows, beer geeks are on their phones to their buddies and it doesn't last long.",4.33
Susan,"One month old. Can to wine glass.L: Pours an opaque golden brownish orange with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing.

Herbal and grassy.T: Malty with caramelly and bready notes on the one side, hoppy with a fruity sweetness on the other side. Honey, peach and a bit of pineapple.F: Crisp and crushable with a medium carbonation. Soft and smooth.O: I think I've never had a beer with less than 8% ABV that was as complex and flavorful as this one. Even though it drinks almost as crisp as a lager, all kinds of malty and hoppy notes keep popping up. Absolutely outstanding.",4.56
Susan,"Canned 12/13/22Alright, it’s time. The highest rated American IPA on BA!! I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, and I’m thrilled to finally get the opportunity to. I’ve been seeing more Hill Farmstead beers near me as time goes on, and I’m excited by all of it. Let’s see if it can truly live up to the hypePours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacingThe nose is somewhat delicate, for lack of a better word, but still shows an excellent balance of all of its elements that ends up turning out really nice. I'm picking up on aromas of orange zest, pine sap, bready malt, grassy hops, honey, pineapple juice, white pepper, grapefruit zest, and light orange marmaladeIn taste it falls a little bit flat of the complexity on display in the aroma, not exactly one-dimensional but more focused on bitterness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting grapefruit zest, piney hops, bready malt, weed, white pepper, honey, light passionfruit, and pineapple. The swallow brings notes of crackery malt, white pepper, piney hops, fresh cut grass, honey, grapefruit zest, passionfruit, and light orangeA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitternessWhile I think this is quite good, it's nothing mind blowing. There's better examples of the style out there, but I'd also like to try this fresher one day, as I've heard HF can be really particular about the best by dates on their IPAs",4

La Fosse,"Taking inspiration from famous Brussel's apricot sour ale, Side Project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style.La Fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. But the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit, funk and fauna. A scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer, sourdough and a brief hint of taffy.But anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. The session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange, mango and peach character. Shying away from fruit rollup, the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay, bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. Its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa, burlap and extended wood-age white wine.Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more Brussels brewed versions, but this brighter, cleaner and fruitier version is just as good.",4.19

Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,"Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glassA: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.S: Almost candied citrus and melon, tropical and stone fruit, earthy, spicy herbal notes, a touch of pine, biscuity malt, and a little caramel honey sweetness.T: Interesting mix of citrus, tropical, and stone fruit, lemon peel, melon, papaya, lime, apricot, a hint of pineapple, and faint tangerine, spicy herbal notes, fairly earthy, a touch of cedar/ pine, biscuity malt, and a little caramel honey sweetness.M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, slightly prickly moderate carbonation, yet it still sits like a silk pillow on the palate.O: I'm not sure if I've been spoiled by really good NEIPAs out here in CA, or if I'm just not the biggest fan of Trillium's style, or both. (This is not the first time that I've had one of their highly rated beers only to be kinda disappointed.)The malt base is beautifully smooth, but the hops come through kinda muddied because of that spicy earthy herbal presence which, given that it's prominently mentioned in the description, is definitely intentional. I can kinda see how some people would be into this more than I am, but I think there are far better ways to add depth of flavor and let the marquis hop shine.",4.5
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,"Pours a hazy yellow orange color with a short and medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a bit as it fades. Smells of melon mainly, a bit of citrus and malt at the end of it. Tastes has a melon sweetness up front that fades to a more bitter hop finish at the end with some citrus in there as well. Feels lighter than it looks, velvety feeling and a nice amount of carbonation. Overall, excellent.",4.5
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,A: Pours an extremely hazy/murky bright golden pale orange in color with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate bright yellow + bright orange + pale golden yellow + peach + apricot colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense sudsy foamy white head that reduces to a handful of small patches of thin film surrounded by a large patch of mottled very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.S: Moderate to strong aromas of citrus/orange zest + citrus/tangerine + tropical/pineapple + melon/cantaloupe + herbal + pine/resinous hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of biscuit + pale + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness.T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of biscuit + pale + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of citrus/orange zest + citrus/tangerine + tropical/pineapple + melon/cantaloupe + herbal + pine/resinous hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which fades away fairly quickly leaving moderate lingering tropical + citrus + herbal hops flavors.M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp upfront with a moderate amount of soft/fluffiness mid-body and a light amount of dryness in the finish.O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a very pleasant slightly crisp + soft/fluffy mouthfeel. Enjoyable with a wonderful hop profile - citrus + citrus/zest + tropical + herbal + pine/resinous.,4.5
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,"Picked up a single from the Blue Door Bottleshop in Hendersonville 10-7-22 for $8.50. No canning date; consumed 10-11-22.Beer poured a hazy golden orange with an okay white head.Nose is awesome! Full of citrus, tropical, and herbal fragrances.Taste is really nicely done. Ultra-light but standard ipa pale malt base is inoculated nicely with an NEIPA yeast strain that provides a touch of stone fruit flavor. Hop additions provide a nice orange and melon flavor injection. Finishes with a nice pine and rind bitterness; 7/10 on my scale.Mouthfeel is near perfection, ultra-light and refreshing.Overall a fantastic NEIPA, definitely amongst the best i have had!",5

Medium-heavy mouthfeel; moderately prickly on the palate; semi-juicy and acidic feel.I was very pleased to find this beer locally and equally happy to drink it.

Some level of sweetness too. Underlay of barley and wheat malt. Quick exit in the aftertaste.Medium mouth feel, with a bit of nectar. Drying finish, and some tooth scraping (acidic).

That color is really stunning though.S: Aromatic and tart berries and cherries up front and center. With an unmistakable earthy funk. There is a bit of oak and vanilla here as well. A really pungent and sharp aroma that I enjoy.T: Oh boy, that sweet tart berry/cherry mix is there. Which becomes super acidic and sour. That funk, light oak and vanilla is there as well. Which tries to help balance. Though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me.M/O: A medium body that has a nice crisp bite. Really well carbonated. Definitely some sweetness as would be expected, but finishes with a dry bite as well. Pretty classic for the style, but still its slow going. That acidity takes over to much.I love 3 Fonteinen, and this is a good example of the style for sure. Though it is unbalanced for me. There are other Fruit Lambic's that I prefer over this, but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make, and I do enjoy it. Just not love it as much as others in the style, or even others from this same brewery. I would recommend this, if you enjoy intense flavors, especially sour acidic cherries.",4

Saison Bernice,"Somehow eluding me for over a decade, despite several trades with SARA locals, my first draft pour at Good Vibes 2023 appears lightly hazy maize yellow-orange with a dense khaki foam blanket that retains well.This exhibits a surprisingly solid funk that's as if oaked, as well as some aged cheese that's cut by an apricot-lemon tartness accented by a refreshing hint of lime.The fairly crisp body finishes just dry in the swallow.I can see why this is so well-regarded.",4.98
Saison Bernice,"Superb appearance in the glass…bright golden yellow color with extremely fine, delicate white head. Aromas of Brett, lemon and grassy hay.

Saison Bernice,"Poured from a capped 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip.Nearly clear Arylide yellow body with a steady stream of micro-bubbles. Off white cap disappears rapidly. Almost no lacing, nor legs.Subtle complex yeast-driven aromatics suffused with poolish, fresh cut hay, and stone fruit. Floral, with a whisper of white wine/champagne.Bright with a balance of light grain/malt, tart meyer lemon/unripe pear, and a faint peppery/barnyard edge from the Brett. Light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover. Long, medium-dry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients.A bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity. What meager roundness is present seems almost (but not quite) chalky.Excellent aroma and flavor, a core expression from the brewery, but the body is more like a lambic than a saison - perhaps this was not a great bottle/batch, but at the price point I'm not eager to roll the dice again right away.",3.75
Saison Bernice,"Brief Review:O: My first SARA beer here, very lucky to grab this from SF on a trip this past April. Been hearing a lot of great things about them for years. Really digging this. Very clean, light, complex. Just a slight funk, not overly tart. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Don't have much to compare it to from the brewery, but as far as saisons and wild ales go, this is certainly top notch.Recommendation: Definitely on par with some things I've had from HF, this is a really good beer from an awesome brewery.",4.49
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"12 oz bottle with a 26 October 2020 bottling date stamped on the back label.Near black body with a thin, semi-durable beige head. A thin dark reddish-brown edge is visible with back lighting. This smells quite sweet, I assume from the bourbon and maple syrup. It has a lightly sweet taste with a laudably balanced mix of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee. Not surprisingly, maple syrup notes are faint. Relatively thick and very smooth body. Well hidden ABV.Overall. The dessert version of KBS.",4.75
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"Poured stout black and was topped by a dense brown head of 1” in height with lots of lacing down the snifter.The aroma was strong, so strong even my Covid affected nose caught a wiff of the chocolate and bourbon.The taste was very well balanced for so much chocolate, and rich chocolate at that. It was the star of the show but the supporting cast of coffee and dark fruits and bourbon were not lost but very present.The feel is darned near ideal for the genre, just a tiny bit less “chewy” or viscous than expected.Good beer, if they brew it again I would drink it fresh instead of cellaring it for 3 years. But even then it is very good.",4.83

KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of chocolate notes with some fudge notes and vanilla and bourbon notes are also perceptible. Taste is a mix of chocolate/fudge with some maple notes and some vanilla and bourbon notes also clearly identifiable. Body is pretty full with good carbonation and light warming alcohol notes. Soldi BA stout with some good adjunct but it does get a little bit cloying at some point.,4.4
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"A bottle dated 08/09/22 refrigerated since purchasing in November of the same year. Poured in a KBS snifter for the review.A vigorous pour produces a dark brown liquid churning up a small finger of tan foam. It settles very quickly to a ring around the glass. The smell is dominated by what else? Mackinac fudge. A slight whiff of dark roast coffee. I'm not getting anything else. The taste is very much like the smell. Pure fudge followed by dark roast coffee. A bit ashy tasting in the finish but nothing that detracts from the experience. The feel is medium bodied, rich and smooth.In all it's pretty typical KBS in that the barrel is invisible. Ditto for any maple in my opinion. I've always been a fan of KBS and appreciate it's simple goodness. This one is worth your time and the price was right at $21/4 pack.",4.57
Coconut B-Bomb,"2017 vintage. Still plenty of coconut flavor. Pours with a brown head and mild lacing. Scents of bourbon, coconut, cocoa, and caramel, all of which carry over to the taste. Hints of dark fruit on the under current. Medium bodied, easy sipper, subtle booze presence. Quite enjoyable.",4.25
Coconut B-Bomb,"This is for the 2019 release; sent to me by @colts9016 as part of NBW BIF #15Poured nearly black, which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. Still, capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing.The aroma was bourbon, and that’s about it.The taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but I couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. Not sure if if it “aged out” or something, but I never found it.The feel was excellent for the flavors, bourbon is a sipping drink you know.I am glad to have tried this, but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible.",4.39

The Greenest Green,"Pours a milky yellow orange with a fluffy off-white head. Taste is sweeter than some of the other members of the Green family, but that's countered by a pithy bitterness. That bitterness is less immediate than other Greens, but seems more long-lasting, maybe due to the creamy mouth-coating body.Overall a beautifully done Treehouse DIPA",4.47

The Greenest Green,"This one pours a very hazy glowing orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.There’s a ton of funky and sweet pineapple on the nose here, some tropical fruit, orange tangerine, and just the lightest floral aroma.Green is a perennial favorite from Tree House, and this is the stickiest and most greentastic version of that I’ve had yet. It’s just super saturated and thick with hop character, without tasting syrupy. There’s loads of the expected pineapple and mango here, with tons of orange and tangerine citrus, and very little bitterness. It’s just got that extra little push beyond Green or Very Green – it’s not a full on uppercut, but it’s definitely a hard shove.This is thick and creamy, with a wonderful drinkability, and no hint at all of the 8.8% ABV.It’s honestly old hat at this point, this is wonderful, of course it is. Tree House has come out of the other side of their expansion extremely successfully.",4.5
The Greenest Green,"Serving: CanCanned: Jul-27-2023Consumed: Aug-13-2023Pours an orangey yellow with lots of haze and a middling white head. Little lacing. Nose is pineapple and bitter orange, resiny oils, little detectable malt presence. The flavor is a wee, little burst of the rinds of those fruits followed by a big (but shortlived) wave of those same fruits… but this time just their bitter, oily, perfumey aromatics. This then dissipates into a lingering, bitter hop buzz and not much else. The mouthfeel is less of that classic round, fluffy juiciness and more total hop saturation. That said, it is quite pleasant and doesn't venture into sappy or hop burny or astringent territory. As it warms, some of the hoppy-yeasty estery sweetness as well as a scoche of malt character come out, but even then it is a one-two-three punch (that's a thing, right?) of the two main facets of the hops: Sweetbitter-bittersweet-bitter in quick succession. Regardless of any way the the beer could be better, this back and forth shift with ever sip is extremely enjoyable and impressive to have pulled off from a brewing perspective.In looking through my reviews of a few of its predecessors, I can see how it is a clear extension of them. The main thing I notice is that in previous amped-up versions, the fruity sweetness held its own and offered a foil to the bitter resinous palate shellac potential contained within the hop profile.In this particular beer, though, the bitter oiliness has overtaken the rest and I have to really seek out the non-bitter aspects of it.They say on the can that this is a result of their series to see how far they could push the envelope before it was too much. Yeah, I could see that. Interesting to have this bitter of a Treehouse beer.4.25...4.5...4.5...4.5...4.5",4.27

As I do, here in this 8 ball black, short mocha headed ale, I get chocolate raspberry sticks and not a ton of barrel. There's just a little bite of slightly herbal wood, which I think more than anything helps to bring us to a powder dry finish.I can see how this would have made the news in its heyday (see what I did there?), but in today's world of absolute confections and bombastic feats of oak, it's quite underwhelming.",4.6

Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13.Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut.Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting.The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable.Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV.I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!",4.5

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Pours a rich, light orange with ample visible carbonation and a light collar of foam. Nose is extremely funky and expressive with elements of dried and wet hay, fresh cut crash, menthol, wood chips, pine, and sap. The aroma continually evolves and builds on itself throughout the course of the drink. Taste follows with an equal complexity and expresses many of those notes from the nose. There's a deep earthiness that underlies it as well, evocative at one moment of the smells of a forest floor or the flavor of a cave aged cheese the next. Overall, this beer does not stop working until it's gone. Remarkable and easily one of the best.",5
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Bottom line: this is a delectable pastry stout worthy of Angry Chair's lofty reputation. They simply seem to have mastered some sort of alchemy regarding the style that few, if any, can match.It's perhaps not a dead ringer for the namesake dessert ... but it honestly isn't far off, and the resemblance grows with successive sips. It's sweet, but not cloying; realistically, it's more rich and decadent than sweet. The coconut is a lovely light touch, never overbearing, but adding another layer to the profile. Chocolate and vanilla are prominent, joined by molasses, cherry, and caramel from the malt base. Incredibly long finish, including lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla.This is another absolute home run from Angry Chair. Every single time I have one of their highest-rated pastry stouts, I think there's absolutely no way it can possibly live up to the hype ... and then it not only matches, but surpasses the hype.",4.5
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"From a 32oz crowler, filled at the brewery 06/03/23. Served in a tulip.Pours a thick-and-viscous appearing motor oil black. A scant quarter-finger of coffee-colored suds lasts a half-minute or so, leaving a soft, creamy collar and a barely rousable oily, sugary film of super-slippery lacing.Nose is roasty-malty, nutty and mildly sweet. Aromas of fudge and dark roast coffee. Some nuttiness and woody, husky coconut as it warms.Taste is fudgy-sweet - but much less sweetness than anticipated. Tasting brown sugar chocolate vanilla fudge, molasses-sweetened coffee and - more prominently and notably as the beer warms - an earthy, woody nuttiness, ground bitter walnut, thick and heavy perfumy vanilla and husky coconut. Nice! Alcohol is hardly noticeable.Feel is smooth and viscous, dense but less thick and heavy than it appeared going into the glass! with super-fine, prickly carbonation making it feel a little lighter than it might otherwise. I want to say that it feels ‘sugary,’ like sugar water but that’s totally hallucinatory - it tastes like it should feel sugary but it does not. Abv is hardly evident.Overall, outstanding! I like to buy these sweet and sticky pastry stouts mainly so that I can complain about them and leave bad reviews but this was so damn good that I was wishing I hadn’t offered to share it with Boy and Spouse. Mammosilenus, who never likes stouts, stole several ounces of this and then came back looking for more and had to be beaten back.",4.98
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Such an awesome beer!

Double Stack,"Double Stack from Great Notion. 16 fl oz can from @snaotheus in NBW BIF 17. Reviewed 14/05/23 (Review 3101). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.Top rim of can stamped “STICKY STACKS 03.06.23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 46.2 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F.Appearance – 4.25First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque with light penetration at the edges – ruby.Head: Average (Maximum 1.1 cm, aggressive center pour), tan, high density, quickly diminishing, reducing to a 0.2 cm crown constantly renewed by carbonation, and a thin partial cap.Lacing – Poor. Thin line of near-microscopic bubbles.Aroma – 4.5 – When the tab is popped, instant aroma of coffee and maple syrup! Weak roasted malt, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on the label).Flavor – 3.5 – Moderately bitter coffee with maple syrup flavor as backing. Bitterness enhanced by the char flavor. No malt, no yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Slight gastric warming.Palate – 4 – Medium; watery short of syrupy/creamy; soft carbonation.Final impression and summation: 4 Without the char bitterness, I would have rated the flavor 4.5; for my taste buds, the char nearly ruined the maple/coffee combo. Otherwise, this is a very good coffee stout. And that “natural flavor and caramel color” screams “Unnecessary crap added”.",4.36
Double Stack,"Canned 3/6/23. ""Sticky stacks"" stamped on the side of the canIt's finally time to try this classic from Great Notion thanks to Tavour. It's their most reviewed beer on BA and their only one to have entered the top 250. This should be their magnum opus. Will it be? Let's crack it open and find outPours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacingThis is absolutely a maple bomb in the nose, but the coffee plays a nice supporting role as well. I'm picking up on aromas of maple syrup, milk chocolate, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, and straight up pancakesIt's surprisingly much more bitter in taste compared to the nose, not to say that it's super bitter but it has a nice bite. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting raw maple, dark roast coffee, charred malt, vanilla, cocoa powder, molasses, light raisin, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, dark roast coffee, cacao nibs, burnt caramel, charred malt, dark toast, and light molassesA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sweet beer with a bite. Finishes a tad sticky but nothing that hurts the drinkabilityIt's not reinventing the wheel of maple adjuncted Stouts, but it's damn good nonetheless",4.42
Double Stack,"Very dark brown color. Aroma is very maple forward with a lot of vanilla, pastry, and coffee notes. Flavor is amazing, so sweet and so much going on— again with the coffee, vanilla, and maple… also toffee and caramel notes. Low bitterness. Very full body with some astringency. Holy crap, would get again, it’s so good! Taking lactase enzyme preemptively with this one because I am concerned.",4.21
Double Stack,"On tap at The Brass Tap, Cedar Falls, IA. Served in a 5-ounce snifter. Pitch black in color, with a thin tan head. Absolutely huge aromas and flavors of maple syrup, dark roast coffee, pancakes, and char. Lots of roasty malt bitterness, without much attendant sweetness. Slightly boozy, with a syrupy mouthfeel. Notes of bitterness and char linger on the palate long after the finish. Overall, well crafted and highly recommended.",4.29
Double Stack,"Aroma gives off a strong, alluring waft of maple and chocolatey malt. Taking a drink feels like getting a huge bite out of a big, fluffy, delicious Belgian waffle coated in maple syrup, followed by a roasty bite of coffee. Nothing I've ever had comes so close to the maple taste, every sip is a breakfast meal in one. Top tier!",4.5
Double Stack,"Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery snifterA: Pours basically black with a frothy tan brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some thin lacing.S: Opening the can is like opening the door to a sugar shack as you're met with a wave of maple, followed by bold coffee, roasty malt, a little char, and faint smoke, light earthy notes, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and slightly toasty biscuity bready pancake-y-ness.T: Opens with a huge hit of maple syrup, followed by milk chocolate, vanilla, and a nice touch of coffee that leads into roasty malt, a little char, and a touch of smoke, with underlying mild earthy and slightly nutty notes, toffee, and toasty biscuity/bready malt very reminiscent indeed of a stack of pancakes.M: Full body, somewhat mild carbonation, pretty smooth though somehow I would describe it as especially creamy, alcohol is rather well hidden giving just the slightest touch of warmth as it comes up to room temp.O: I've had a couple cans of this sitting in the fridge for a few years now, just waiting for the right night to crack into my special liquid souvenirs from a great road trip. But as time passed and that night never came, I got on the lookout for a fresh can to purposely do the opposite with; to push to the front of the line as quickly as possible and try fresh. A lucky shipment of cans hit my area recently, so here we are, cracking into a can that's a little more than a month old.This beer probably has the strongest maple presence of any beer I've ever had, including CBS. To their credit, you definitely get the sensation of taking a big bite of pancakes dripping with syrup after just taking a sip of your morning mocha. Unfortunately, that kinda leads into its downfall. While it is true to their own description of having an ""extreme maple syrup flavor"", it can come off as ungodly sweet up front. Not gonna lie, I'm also a little weary of the label saying ""coffee, maple syrup, natural flavor, and caramel color"", potentially meaning there's some kinda maple or 'pancake extract' in there. This one is fun to try, but could really benefit from some balance; upping the coffee, backing the maple down a notch, maybe even both would help make it less of a novelty and more of an enjoyable sipper you go back to. Maybe some age will do the trick. I'll definitely update when that right night comes along and I get into my vintage cans. For now, I'd say it's a cool one to try as a short pour, but it can get overwhelming in greater volumes.",4.25

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2019 bottle, Drank 7/31/23Pours dark black, zero carbonation. Strong pleasant aroma of chocolate and molasses. Taste is much of the same with an added hint of coffee and bourbon barrel. Feel is thin, and FLAT which really distracts from this being a top BA stout for me.

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Lift Bridge Silhouette Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. 2014. Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season.""",4
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle.I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers.It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!",4.75
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"REview#1600,This thing is all barrel, but that's not a bad thing in this case. If I had to say something bad about it I would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times, overpowering and (this sounds dumb) kinda too smooth at other times... unbeer-like if that makes sense, tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory",4.33
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Pours black with leakage to mahogany brown on the edges and a tan head. The nose has oaky, boozy barrel notes, some dark chocolate, and stone fruit.The barrel is forward on the taste, coasting into the dark chocolate and stone fruit notes, which works really well.

Aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking. Slightly watered down but wonderful flavor overall. I enjoyed the draft version more and this bottle was a bit of a letdown. Solid beer but plenty better.",4.4
Bomb!,"Look: exceptionally dark brown, almost black. Very thin mocha colored head, minor lacing.Smell: very well-mixed chocolate and vanilla fight for dominance. Moderately strong coffee and malt.Taste: follows the nose. The chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and malt sweetness are all present. Nothing is overpowering. No real taste of chile peppers until the back end (see feel).Feel: rich, silky, velvety, and smooth. Low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. Warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. Tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow.Overall: one of the best - and possibly THE best - adjunct imperial stout I have ever had the fortune of trying. Exquisitely well-balanced flavors.",4.09

Bomb!,"From a 12oz bottle, dated 03/17/22. Served in a tulip.Pours a slightly thick-appearing chestnut-black with a finger of dense mocha foam. The head holds up for thirty seconds or so - actually pretty good considering the abv - leaving a scant collar and a barely rousable spattering of super-slippery lacing.Nose is rich and chocolatey. Aromas of milk chocolate and chilis.Taste is candy bar-like, mildly sweet, nutty and lightly roasted. Sweetened coffee taste is present but dominated by Lindt-type milk chocolate at the beginning, then by ancho chili and vanilla on the back end. Tasting demerara sugar, mocha java, ancho chili and vanilla. There’s a subtle nutty, peanut buttery character at the end and into the aftertaste.Feel is smooth and creamy, not much more than medium bodied I think, but further lightened by the ample, fine carbonation. It’s a notably clean mouthfeel considering the style, the abv, and the various adjuncts.Overall, nice. Clean-drinking and tasty, only lightly sweet and not at all syrupy. At least comparable to many of the finer imperial stouts I’ve met but perhaps at a more regrettably unattractive relative price point.",4.47

Huge spicy chili chocolate up front followed by a easy vanilla ride to the coffee profile in the after taste. Man oh man this one is top 5 in the books.F: Spicy, acidic, heavy bodied beer - not to carbonated. Easy to drink, can't taste the alcohol at all.O: This reminds me of a similar imperial stout made with spices that resemble chili peppers. This for me is a barrel aged version of Ducato Verdi Imperial Stout but with different characteristics that make it much more complex such as a spicy bakers chocolate upfront taste followed by a smooth vanilla ride to the end where the coffee after taste lingers.

Consecration,"Served from a tap in a clear pint glass, it's modest biege head didn't last long. The brew is a deep brown-amber, almost mahogany, bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. The only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. The barrel tannins dominate even the Brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. Yet, the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. There are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. This is also a little tart, but it's unmistakably sour. The woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste. Other than that, there's no complaint here. The high ABV isn't noticed, the taste is full and complex, delivered within a body that's rich for the style.",4.64

It's more balanced than I would have given it credit for based on the aroma and the first sip. But it's fizzy and tart without much flavor, to my palate. I don't get fruit, I don't get wine barrel. I don't get chocolate or tobacco or any of the other flavors printed on the label.

Congress Street IPA,"Poured with a soft thick head comprised of tiny bubbles, like steamed milk for a latte. Nose is all Galaxy - pineapple, peach, citrus and rind as well as hints of melon. Trillium seems to have a knack for highlighting melon notes from several different hops, and melon is in the foreground in the taste, which is fruity but not sweet, with a nice gentle bitterness on the finish.",4
Congress Street IPA,"Pours like a mix of lemon and orange juice, nicely hazy with a soft pillowy head. Honestly the nose didn't match the beer, a little yeasty and muddy. Lots of citrus notes but not overly sweet so it had a nice balance. An exemplary hazy ipa, one that is equally drinkable and cherishable.",4.29

The chocolate lead up the flavor profile.Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation.Drink: Very well rounded.

Mocha Wednesday,"2021 vintage. Pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. Bits of carb hitting the surface. No lacing/retention. Nose is roasted coffee beans, molasses, black licorice, loose change, baking chocolate. Very little barrel character, at least initially. Kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesn't lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there, they feel like parts of a whole that developed together, rather than some gunk that's thrown in and overpowers the product. Taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. Through its very long finish, dark chocolate and dark fruit, vanilla, smoky wood, salty black licorice, and finally, traces of warming, spicy bourbon emerge. As on the smell, a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering, but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. The feel is surprisingly thin, and I think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the ABV. Really worth seeking out.",4.75
Mocha Wednesday,"2016 vintage. Poured from a brown wax topped bomber into a Tree House tulip. 19.4% ABVL: Lighter than expected pour. Medium to dark mahogany color with ruby highlights. A thin fizzy off-white head falls fast. Not much in the way of lacing.S: Rich and boozy. BOOZE. Bourbon and vanilla... some oak, cocoa, and coffee. Mostly booze.T.F: Sweet and rich. Boozy... as expected at 19.4%. Deliciously complex. Cocoa and coffee mixed with oak, roast, and fudge. The coffee and chocolate especially come through and are nicely complemented by the bourbon and vanilla. A little thinner than expected. Medium bodied... boozy, but not as much as the 19.4% would make you think. Still very drinkable. Low carbonation. Coffee/cocoa finish.O: An outstanding overdone ABV stout. Great barrel character... and you get a lot of bourbon, chocolate, and coffee on this brew. Held up super well at 6+ years in the cellar. This is an all-night sipper of a beer.",4.63
Mocha Wednesday,"750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 10/21/21, label says 19.1% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away kinda quickly but leaves a small bit of head. Small amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, vanilla, cacao nibs and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too. Good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a pretty good brew, definitely worth picking up if you're into big barrel aged coffee stouts!",4.88

Strong scents of bourbon, coconut, and chocolate. This follows to the taste, as it’s very sweet and boozy, but the flavors blend well. Big bodied, just a hint of oiliness, not thick or syrupy, but assertive alcohol burn. Really tasty.",4.48

This is batch 003.L: Poured from a 500ml bottle into a snifter - jet black pour with 1 fingers length of dark malty foam risen to the surface.S: Big fudgy chocolatey aromas of coconut, cacao, vanilla, hazelnut, even getting some lactose in this.

This is my favorite bottle logic barrel aged to this day!F: Heavy, oily thick bodied, easy to sip. Hides ABV very so well.O: This is hard to compare with prairie pirates weekend but man this takes the top spot. My new all time favorite coconut chocolate stout of all time. The reason is because the milk chocolate was there, cacao was there, coconut was there followed by the complexity and thickness of the beer. Two separate beers but I'd be very curious to see if they aged this in rum barrels. This might change the whole stout game itself if that were to be the case.",4.5

Peche Du Fermier,"Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.Blend #2. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.",4.56

CitraQuench'l,"Juicy looking pour. The color seems a bit lighter golden. It really looks like a glass of pineapple juice, but with a very frothy and fluffy 2 finger white head. The beer has great head retention, and there's a good amount of lacing on the glass.To be honest, I'm not getting much on the nose. It's a fairly faint citrus hop aroma.Taste - There's a citrus flavor to this beer due to the hops, and I think it's tangerine that I'm getting from the hops. The flavor from the hops really keeps building in my throat, and on my taste buds. The flavor lingers in my throat, and I just keep tasting it.The body is juicy and also has a crisp feeling. The hops linger in my throat, but they don't feel sticky, or like resin.This is a delicious example of the style. The aroma was a bit of a let down, it is a bit over a month old, so maybe that plays a factor into it. That being said, the flavor is there.",4.44
CitraQuench'l,"Had on tap at the Bass Lake Draft House in Holly Springs, NC.This was a tasty hazy IPA. Not a great amount of head, but the hazy appearance and color were good for the style.

Insert Hip Hop Reference There,"This is a great tasting IPA. Nice Citra flavor, nice mouth feel and definitely hoppy. It's a triple, so the hoppiness is to be expected. The mouth feel is very good, but not the best I have had. Definitely a world class beer! Nice job!",4.25

Reaction State,"Cinnamon is becoming my kryptonite so I’m hoping it’s been used with an appropriately light touch in this 500ML bottle, ‘cause I like everything else added to this brute.Hard black with a few stray brown bubbles that quiet swiftly. Oh Oh. Cinnamon bite is strong on the nose. Please, no, brew deities.Reaction State tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge. Cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesn’t quite crush it into submission. Underneath the spice are touches of maple, vanilla, & the ghost of cocoas past. Light bourbon winds its way betwixt & between & the finish is mulled apple cider. Should have split this one with my wife.Hey brewers: quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers. If you can’t get the balance right, throw the crap away. Pretty good beer, which is sad, as I can sense something really good underneath the cinnamon avalanche.",4.77
Reaction State,"Pours a dark brown like motor oil. Just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly.Nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout. Its got that rich, dense, still wet barrel level of intensity. Huge oak profile. I love it. Next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate. This reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time; Weyerbacher's Chocolate Pretzel Sunday Morning Stout. Then in the background, there lies the cinnamon.Taste is much of the same on the nose. Oak, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cinnamon. But now I get the slight bit of maple syrup. Maple syrup presents almost with, I hesitate to say this, but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes. Like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess. It doesn't detract, but it is a unique quality. The tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts. Its incredibly mild and doesn't linger, but thats why I decided to put it at a 4.5 rather than 4.75, similar to the nose.Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning. ABV makes its presence known, but not as severely as that Maumasi I had the other night. There is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down.Overall my favorite Bottle Logic brew so far. I was surprised because I though this was just going to be another ""breakfast stout"", but this one actually blew me away. Well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and don't feel like novelty additions. Masterclass level stuff.",4.23
Reaction State,"Opaque midnight black pour with a finger of brown foam. Smells of big coffee and maple forward nose with vanilla, chocolate and molasses accents. Taste is incredible, hype meeting even: coffee, rich dark chocolate, molasses and the difference, lush bourbon, before vanilla, cinnamon, and bigger maple elevate to a finish with espresso biscotti and a lingering caramel nougat. Lush, rich, smooth, full and decently thick with good barrel warmth and coffee percolation.",4.5
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),",#171, fantastic!",4.25
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"2020 vintage. A very solid and canonical example of the style, perhaps *the* prototype of what a bourbon barrel aged RIS should emulate. I find the style to be a little bit on the roasty, herbaceous side and this was no exception. The barrel aging did smooth things out quite a bit in the flavors, although I was surprised that the mouthfeel wasn't fuller. Overall very glad to finally try this but I definitely prefer Beyond Good and Evil, and their other sweeter BBA stouts85/100",4.94
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Bottled 1/10/2020Consumed 10/28/2022I just got a job offer today, so I needed to pull something out of my cellar to celebrate. I traded a bottle of EH Taylor small batch for this bottle of beer, so let's see if it lives up the hype and $50 I paid for the bourbon. It does look spot on amazing. It's super thick but not syrupy in a bad way. This is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave. On the tongue it's super full and soft. Absolutely perfect for the style for me. I'm not getting enough on the nose though to wow me. I get bourbon and chocolate. I smell the typical lovely bitterness of a RIS. Still, it's lacking in the nose for me. Drinking it though everything lives up to the hype. It's less sweet than a typical Goose BCS which set the standard for me back in the day. I can taste the booziness but in a good way. I like high abv stouts where I can taste the alcohol a bit. Why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isn't front and center? What's different and great is that there's also the balance of the base beer. There's a lot of plain old RIS here. Take your best like a Darkness or Expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly. The finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee. A great beer and worth the bourbon (at retail.)",4.52
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),Hands down the best beer I’ve ever had!,4.5
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Pours a deep, black with a thin mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly. The aroma gives notes of charred oak, bourbon, dark fruits, dark roast coffee, and vanilla. The flavor is less sharp, and more rich with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, chocolate chip cookie, and oaky bourbon and vanilla. The flavor lingers well after the sip with rich, chocolatey cookie flavors. The body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy, leading to a very balanced finish. Overall, a very flavorful and drinkable beer. One of my favorite BBA Stouts I have ever had, very well balanced flavor and mouthfeel. Highly recommended.",4.58

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Bottled on 1/10/2020; consumed on 1/29/2022Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.",4.2

Good.Starry Noche is thick, but you knew that. It’s full of raw coconut flavor, but it says that right on the bottle. Big, sweet malts, but hey, imperial stout, am I right? And barrels, which is in smaller type amid a 121 word description of the beer: the bourbon is swinging low, the rye is bringing a small dose of spiciness. Nary a trace of booziness, which is impressive, & means that one/me could drink a full 500ML without blinking. I am still blinking. Like a leaf tailed gecko.One of the better of the pantheon.

There’s a LOT packed into this big beer.The taste has a nice boozy note up front that is not distracting at all, and flows into the milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, and dark cherry flavors, with a nice warming alcohol note at the back of the palate.

Hold On To Sunshine,"Poured from 16oz can into pint glass in February 2023, that I purchased at their brewery in Charlton, MA. There is a date of Winter 2023 on the bottom of the can, and I drank this about 1 month after I purchased it.Appearance: Very dark black with 1-finger head. The head was dark brown, and disappeared after a minute. It left only a little lacing on the glass, and no head remained after a minute.Smell: Strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened. Roasted coffee, caramel, and chocolate aromas. Not much hop style citrus or pine aromas.Taste: There is taste of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Also, some vanilla, peanut butter, and roasted malt flavors. They are more balanced than I expected from the aroma. Flavors are very bold. There is a strong alcohol presence that matches 7.6% advertised. A sweet chocolate, and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee, that is really enjoyable.Mouth-feel: Very thick, but with an extremely smooth and creamy body.This is a very good Porter, and one of the best Porters I have ever drank. It has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. The balance of flavors is outstanding. The flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors. This is even better than the Tree House Cartharsis Porter, which is very good. This is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. I have enjoyed all the beers I've bought at Tree House, and I would buy this again.",4.5
Hold On To Sunshine,"Dark brown with a half finger of audibly fizzy dark khaki head that quickly settles into a lasting crown. No real lacing.Roast peanuts, peanut butter, roasted malt and quality breakfast blend coffee in the aroma.The taste spotlights peanut butter, very light chocolate and caramel and some roastiness from the complementary coffee.Creamy, full bodied feel with a mouth-coating oiliness and light zip to the carbonation.Peanut beers aren’t my thing, but this is a very nicely made one.",4.39

A lot of very fine floaters visible.Smell: Peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints. Almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms.Taste: Peanuts, chocolate and coffee. Slightly sweet, somehow roasty and minimally bitter.Feel: Creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation. Quite smooth.Overall: No barrel-aging, no double digit ABV, but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination. All flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability. There are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one I‘ve had so far.",4.75
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"22 oz bomber (2015)A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout.S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact.T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal.M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer.",4.91
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit.",4.48

Surprisingly good retention.Molasses, chocolate covered cherries, medium-roast coffee, maple candy, and complex malt in the nose.Stale coffee, milk chocolate, weak tobacco, and brown sugar on the palate.

Darkness,"2016 Vintage served at 52 degrees.While the color of this beer is like pretty much every other stout, what stands out is the glorious, thick and persistent dark tan colored head. Beautiful looking consistency and excellent lacing. Rare for me to think of a stout as anything above a 3.75, but this is getting a 4.5Nose isn't up to the same level as the look, but it's still really nice, highlighted by loads of chocolate, toffee and faint roast. Taste largely follows, but with much more roast & coffee. Body is not quite as hefty as I anticipated. I want to say it's light, but it also feels like a milkshake, and those two things don't seem to make sense together, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Regardless, this is quite tasty. Glad I finally cracked it open.",4.2

Darkness,This beer is dark but not dark like used motor oil. Smells of roasted coffee. This is one beer where you definitely have to let sit out for awhile to really taste it. Has a strong malt taste and not boozy at all.,4.57
Darkness,"2021 vintageI’ve been sitting on this one for a minute now and I’m excited to finally try it. An absolute classic RIS, and one that totally caught me off guard when I saw it at the store, just sitting on the shelf. This is also my first beer from Surly so I’m even more hyped. Let’s tackle this massive beastPours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacingThere’s still a solid bitterness to this for being 2 years old which is quite surprising to me. I’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops, burnt caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, charred wood, dark roast coffee, light vanilla, and red grapeWhile still bitter in taste, it feels like it’s integrated much better than the nose. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, cocoa powder, charred malt, caramel, vanilla bean, black cherry, sweetened coffee, light earthy hops, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of res grape, black cherry, molasses, milk chocolate, light roast coffee, leafy hops, vanilla bean, sweet caramel, and charred maltA full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and lightly boozy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over timeOh yeah, this is really good. Warm and complex, it develops over the course of the drink. I’ll have to try other vintages",4.42
Darkness,"Straight 5s. Sublime is my word for 2023 and it applies here. Labeled a RIS, this is not the traditional version. While high in abv and pitch black, it is super creamy and loaded with underlying tones of dark dried fruit like prunes, figs, or dates, and subtle hints of cocoa and coffee. I am not suggesting they are added, but they are present in the flavor profile. This stout is truly remarkable and I am so happy it is available locally (PA) for the first time in forever.",4.08
Darkness,"Canned 10/19/22, enjoyed 1/9/23Poured pitch black, very slowly as the tan head was quite aggressive.

The front was the sweet part and the middle the savory with the swallow bringing in the hops to keep it from going all mushy.The feel was spot on, a very nice sipper and just overall an excellent RIS.",4.77

Notes of raisins, ancho chili, and tequila follow. There was even a hint of lime. After a few sips, heat built up in the throat in the aftertaste.Mouthfeel - The body was smooth and thick, perhaps just above medium bodied. Carbonation was noted.Overall - I love tequila aged stouts.",4.25
Leche Borracho,"Matte black with brown speckling and head. This strikes me as a more chocolatey and spicy westbrook mexican cake, plus bourbon and tequila backing obviously. Nice “French toast effect” with cinnamon, some light caramel within the chocolate in the taste exclusively. Smooth feel in between pepper spice hits, well done by the way, and the spiced textures of the cinnamon. Taste is more clear in the flavors, where smell is amalgamation of it all.

Crusher,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned June 21st 2023.Hazed and opaque body with a muted orange but fairly dark and still. A mix of custard but has a much darker than expected color. The beer nearly appears frozen. Head is quite soapy, fine white bubbles of three fingers with light retention. Shampoo like top but lots of ring lacing to match.Aroma is a hop surprise. Hints of soft dank, but a real gumdrop like candy sweetness that matches nicely. Thick and rich, with a light sense of sweet malt to counter as well. The contrast between dank and sweet hop aroma on this is exceptional. Huge juicy dank sweet punch is the only way I can describe it, like hop thick Kool-Aid.Palate brings things a little more into focus, but does not hold back. Mid palate hits with a hot but delicious earthy mid palate punch. Large and bold, but controlled hop blasts of pine, earth, juiced candy orange pineapple and mango rolling into a minty finish that just does not quit. It doesn't stop there, with a creamed earthy mouthfeel that feels like a sundae, and smells like sweet tilled garden earth.A bit of a punishing sensation, but in a real good way, Crushing indeed.",4.21

It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too.

It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine. It has the expected effervescence and it doesn't drink like 10% ABV. Overall, Blanc De Blancs is an absolute delight. I'm privileged to have had the chance to try it.",4.25
Miles To Go Before I Sleep,"Poured into a 13 oz Teku glass says canned Spring of 2023. Pours midnight black with 2 plus finger sticky mocha head that leaves a thin wall of lace, with excellent retention. 4.75Aroma is peanut butter cup, cocoa, coffee milk, Oreo, caramel, and toffee. 4.75Taste follows peanut butter and chocolate dominates, with some roasted coffee, caramel, toffee, and vanilla bean. 4.75Mouthfeel is above average, not sticky or dry, soft gentle carbonation, and 9.1% ABV it goes down extremely easy. 4.25Overall this is a very tasty stout, I still wish it had a little bigger body, but still really impressive. 4.5",4.5
Aurelian Lure,"16.9oz bottle. For dating, label includes the details of 'BLEND SEVEN AUGUST 2022'.Cloudy, apricot orange colored body. No real lasting head. No lacing.Aroma of apricot, oak, and rich funk of expresses horse blanket, leather, and hay.Taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like, and then the sweet/sour apricot comes in. Notes of lemon wash through, along with the dry oak. Late is white wine. The funk is very much of grass and hay. After taste does not last very long, but the essence of apricot lingers.Tart and drying mouth feel. The teeth are scraped clean with each sip. Quiet carbonation.The apricot expresses so naturally here, and is the longest lasting flavor note. The herb, oak, funk, and lemon are worthy subordinates.",3.68
Aurelian Lure,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a bubbly collar that fades away; no lacingSmell: Bracingly sour; funky with an apricot toneTaste: A hint of apricot passes across the tongue and is followed by a strong funky character; the apricot tone lingers underneath though, after the swallow, a bracing sourness emerges; oaky, dry and a lot of pucker in the finishMouthfeel: Light to medium body; no carbonationOverall: Not for the uninitiated, Aurelian Lure harkens back to some of the tongue buckling sours that largely seem to have gone out of fashion these days",3.83
Aurelian Lure,"Brewed with apricots, spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity, you'd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of Brussels. But nope, it's Austin Texas.Aurelian Lure is the lambic-like brainchild of Jester King, pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center. As the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth, the jaw-tightening scent of citrus, vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider, dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine. As a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue, early impressions of wafers, honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact.A quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon, grapefruit, lime and yuzu. Dried pineapple, peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of off-vinegar, mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue.Light, crisp, succinct and highly refreshing, the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south. As an afterglow of weathered woods, wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves, the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey.",4.24
Aurelian Lure,"Murky darker yellow body with a white cap. Smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak, orange and farmhouse yeast. Taste is a cover up of the scandal. The scandal you ask? The apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too, this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast, light barrel funk, lemon, and oak, but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough. Very bright and sour, funk is not impactful here, oak is brightly so, acidity builds as the secret wants to get out. I love JK but this is the #15 wild ale in the world? Nah, I wouldn't have this again",4.31
Aurelian Lure,"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately. The aroma is immediately noticeable, with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak. Upon tasting, the apricot flavor dominates, with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness. The oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity, imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots. The beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue, leaving a dry finish.One of the standout features of Aurelian Lure is its balance. Despite being a sour ale, the tartness is not overwhelming, and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes. This makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style.Another noteworthy aspect of Aurelian Lure is its mouthfeel. The beer is medium-bodied with a light carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. The combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer, though it's enjoyable year-round.Overall, Jester King Brewery's Aurelian Lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewery's expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation. It's a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel. While it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability, it's certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special.",4.5

Juicy,"Bottled on February 14, 2020. Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat.On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity.Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine.",4.5

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"2023-07-03375ml bottle served in a little snulip. Vintage 2022. Got it from @ozzylizard in NBS BIF #17.Pours black with no head, looks still. Smell is bourbon and vanilla, burnt toffee and near-burnt nuts, sweet molasses, hint of something like cinnamon or nutmeg.Taste is (for me) dominated by cinnamon. Nuts are still there, and something comes across as milk chocolate. Molasses sweetness. I was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me, and then I read on the label that it contains habaneros, and that's clearly evident now that I saw it. As it's warming up, the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful.Mouthfeel is nicely thick and chewy. Overall...it appears to be a pretty good stout with a nice level of pepper, but too much cinnamon for me.",4.36
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,I fell in love with this beer from the beauty on the label to the deep dark color to smooth finish. I used to drive all the way to Danvers to purchase it at Total Wine.

Oddly, no habaneros. No ethanol (13.7 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma.Flavor – 4.5 – The habaneros set up a nice oral burn, not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor. Cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste. Initially no hops, malt, or yeast; light chocolate and ghostly vanilla. Slight gastric warming, but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.Palate – 4 – Medium; creamy; soft carbonation.Final impression and summation: 4.25 Lacking both head and lacing, the appearance loses a few points. Both the flavor and aroma are quite good, with distinct hits of habaneros, cinnamon, cocoa, and even detectable vanilla, all supported by the bourbon and barrel. Very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six. Extra points for having a lizard on the label.",4.46
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle, the body is a dark cola brown. Small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence.Aroma is a complex mix of bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, and chile. The habanero aroma is muted but present.Taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose. You'll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made (Oil of Aphrodite). The habanero is felt in the swallow, but it's a light heat. In fairness, I love habs and you might perceive more heat. The cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout. A bit more malty char would be welcome, but that's a personal preference and not a complaint.Mouthfeel is good but not great. I'd love a bit more body in this stout. More carbonation would be welcome.Overall an outstanding stout that I interestingly found a bit better when colder than I usually drink stouts. The mix seemed more flavorful when first poured.",4.5

More of the bitter Chocolate and Coffee end of the spectrum. It is mellow, and not boozy (for me). Mouth feel is medium, and not too chewy. Just right actually.

Some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose, but not enough to be offensive. As many other reviews state, there is a lot going on in this offering. Every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that I did not pick out in the previous. The barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA2022Served in a Tree House Brewing Company tulipThe beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well.Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest.

Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.",4.5
Abraxas,"2022 vintage. Cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful.This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick.FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful.Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first.",4.44
Abraxas,"Truly an excellent beer!Bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past March. I decided to have it for Father’s Day!Poured into a tulip glass. Rich, oily dark brown color with a brown head and excellent curtain lacing. Needed to let it warm for the nose to open a bit. Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel. I would love to try the barrel aged version sometime. A great Father’s Day treat!",4.5
Abraxas,"Deep copper with a 1/2"" tan head, which slowly fades. Minimal lacing.Aroma of cinnamon, chocolate, hot pepper, vanilla, caramelly as it warms.Taste is cinnamon, peppers, chocolate, roasty, vanilla stronger on the nose than palate.Full body, light carbonation. Thick & oily finish.Bottled 10/23/17. As expected with a 5 year old high ABV stout, it has little head & minimal lacing. Apart from that, this is a very good Imp Stout.",4.75

Abraxas,"L: Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter - heavy black pour with very little dark foam risen to the surface.S: Notes of chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, vanilla, cinnamon. Very on point with the description and it’s awesome because you can smell the chili in there as well.T: Wow. Definitely getting the bakers/ milk chocolate upfront along with some vanilla, cinnamon, dark fruits, chili peppers and malts. This is so good!F: Thick, syrupy, heavy bodied, easy to drink. The abv hides very well in this.O: I knew once I read chili it would be a hit or miss because sometimes with other beers you can’t taste it as much but this hits it on point. Great job!",4.08

Abraxas,"2022 VintageCONTAINS: LactoseWay too sweet and unbalanced, with some off flavors.",4.4
Abraxas,"Poured into a tulip. Very modest head. Zero lacing. Very dark brown, but not quite black. Essentially opaque. Not as viscous as some of the style.Very pleasant and melded aromas. Chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, and cashew.Roasty but sweet malts on the tip of the tongue. Coffee and nutty/vanilla notes in midstream. Bitterness boosts here to the end. The cinnamon gives way to the ancho warmth at the finish. Hides the booze well.Medium-full bodied but not quite chewy. Modest carbonation but not sticky or cloying.This brew and Bomb! are sixes and sevens for me, and that's a high compliment. This is a more restrained take, with a bit less sweetness and heat and more nutty goodness.",4.42

Stickee Monkee,"12oz bottle 2018 vintage that turned up in my LBS this week poured into a chalice at 47°F 11.4% ABV. The beer pours opaque medium brown with light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and little else. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring candi sugar, raisin, bourbon and leather. The taste is semisweet caramel, bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco, oak and leather on the finish. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a semi dry finish. ABV is well hidden with just a touch of heat on the back end and no ethanol aroma or taste. Overall, excellent.",4.1
Stickee Monkee,"Rare 2015 vintage draught pour at Apex Bar in Portland OR.Presented flat. No foam at all. Deep brown, borders on black.Smells great. Dark stone fruits and that famiiar Quad on the nose.Taste is toes on the line too sweet, but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. I think maybe because it’s 7 years old, some if the nuances intended have been lost. But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew.Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.Overall, good to get a draught hit, but 7 years of hiding has worn its beauty down.",3.75
Stickee Monkee,"2018 vintage, poured into a FW mini snifter.Dark brown pour with minimal carbonation. Scents of candi sugar, caramel, and dried fruit. Sweet flavor of candy, and a warming finish. Certainly a fine example of the style, and one that aged well.",5
Stickee Monkee,"2021 Vintage consumed on 10-30-2022A bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. Dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head, with a fairly aggressive pour. The retention is decent, and there's some lacing on the glass.The aroma is strong with dark fruit - I get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose.Taste - Tons of plum and raisin hit up front. There's a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. I also get a creamy flavor mixing in, almost a lactose flavor. This last thing surprised me, probably not getting it right.The body is very thick and full. Smooth, and very little alcohol burn.I love this beer, and so glad I bought it.",4.46
Stickee Monkee,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.",4.44

Stickee Monkee,"2021 vintageSweet overall but with a lot layers to keep it interesting. Brown sugar and toffee up front plus some subtle raisin. The end adds a nice lightly tart cherry note and subtle oak. The bourbon notes are smooth, mellow, and well incorporated.",4.5
Stickee Monkee,"2016 Vintage. Poured at 54°. Brown with ruby body; good clarity; quick beige head; thin ring, poor cap retention, no lace; thin legs. Fruity esters; caramel malt, leather, tobacco, candied yams. Taste follows with caramel apple sweetness, bourbon, oak, and brown sugar/molasses. Feel is thin silk, body is medium, carbonation is light; faint warmth from 11.6%. abv. Overall a WC BA Quad style!, no oxidation after almost 6 years, the nose is heady fruity corse earthy aromas, the taste is subtle - rich umami base with dancing sweeter notes of sugar, fruit and Belgian yeast in the higher register. A beer worthy of aging and May even advance another 2-3 years taste-wise - onward Science!",4.49

Samuel Adams Utopias,"2017 vintage - shared with me from a friend. Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV).Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich.Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well.Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming.Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty.",4
Samuel Adams Utopias,"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.Damn I wish I didn't like this as much as I do. There is just no way to justify buying another bottle, but this is absolutely worth trying once.",4.92
Samuel Adams Utopias,"2019 vintagePours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts, warm roasted malts, sweet maple syrup, pecans, walnut, dark dessert wines, port, sherry, madeira, some cognac liquor, cherry, toffee, caramel, bourbon, oaky char, hints of baking chocolate, red grape, mild bitter herbs, caraway, subtle spice, raisins, dark dried fruit, brown bread, fruitcake, and a touch of vanilla. Feels medium-full bodied, slick, oily, strong and smooth. Overall a real great and unique barrel-aged sipper.",4.46
Samuel Adams Utopias,Had multiple years. Very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer. More like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyable.Great conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly.,5
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this.",4.5
