    "__Part A.__ Visitors to your website are asked to answer a single survey question before they get access to the content on the page. Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3.  After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65\\% said Yes and 35\\% said No.   What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes?  Hint: use the rule of total probability."
